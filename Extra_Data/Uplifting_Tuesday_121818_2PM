There are multiple game studios with multinational reputations that are based in the UK, particularly Rockstar Games (the founder of the company, the Houser Brothers, are British; One of their flagship game studios - Rockstar North - based in Scotland, developed multiple Grand Theft Auto Games) and the establishment of such union could force game studios to look into the Crunch Time issue (a time when video game developers have to stay over time for weeks to deliver a game within its scheduled release date) and come up with a solution about it.\n\nJust roughly two months ago, Rockstar Games was embroiled in a controversy when one of its co-founder, Dan Houser, said that ""we were working 100-hour weeks"" on their forth coming Red Dead Redemption 2. Although Houser later clarified his statement that the 100-hour weeks were only limited to himself and three other writing team members over a period of ""weeks, not months"", and not all workers at Rockstar Games are like that, there were several anecdotal statements made by former Rockstar employees chronicling their hectic working experiences for the company, especially weeks before the release of a Triple-A title game which often subjects its workers to Crunch Time.

They used social media, they organized walk-ins, communities banded and petitioned their local representatives for the government to do something, and everyone just kept on pushing and pushing. On the local level, people barged in to their local party meetings and demanded the floor. On social media, people organized non-stop petitions to flood government accounts. They got celebrities to do ads, public roadshows, and interviews. Artists and performers did their pieces - even got a dedicated ""pollution watch"" segment done on CCTV on a regular basis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome people got arrested, some lost their jobs, and some people were evicted from the party. But in the end, the government decided to act and made anti-pollution a theme at the national congress.

The truth is that the government reflects the will of the people, and people, no matter if they\'re Chinese or American or European, are not simple creatures.

China is investing so much in infrastructure because people demanded it.  China got rid of the one-child policy because people clamored for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes - China is locking down Xinjiang because the people wanted it.

This isn’t a cut and dry issue and honestly the disrespect to an industry that was absolutely vital to modern society is disgusting.\n\nIt is easy to sit back and criticize and dehumanize these miners but for most people they can’t even begin to comprehend their position. People working in mines range from 18-mid 60s (retirement ages vary) and the situations each are in are equally as diverse. A miner in their teens and early 20s can take training opportunities and flourish in many situations. As you increase the age the ability to retrain and make the wages they are used to diminish quickly. Part of that is due to how trying to enter a new industry works. Another important factor is mining communities are generally secluded, lack job diversity, and mines hold massive economic contributions not only to those communities but surrounding communities so now these people are having to uproot. Mix it all together and now you also have a flood of basic trained candidates flooding nearby communities all trying to compete for jobs. Every aspect economically is awful.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong I do support the reduction of coal and it is absolutely something that needs to be done. That however doesn’t mean the people or the industry need to be treated so terrible. Coal miners and really the mining industry in general have and continue to contribute tremendously. Without coal the industrial revolution would have never happened. Without that we would be living in a drastically different world. Mining in general feeds the necessary commodities for basic growth around the world. Disregarding that to completely villianize and toss away these people that are STILL working for a world that STILL needs them is disgusting and ignorant (ironically with how some of you talk).

She posted his p;ix on Facebook, Ozias said, but later brought the dog back and dumped him at a residence close to where she had found the dog.  \nUnfortunately, the occupants were not home, Ozias said.  \nOzias, vice president of the Warrensburg Cat Advocates, said members of the group went out and searched for the dog until 4 a.m., and the next day, community members who heard about the dog, searched the neighborhood and surrounding area looking for it without success.  \nThey then learned someone else had picked up the dog and had gone door-to-door in the Cedar Groves area trying to locate the owner. When the person was unable to find anyone to take the dog, it then was dumped again “in the middle of nowhere,” Ozias said.  \nShe said people in the community were sharing posts on social media from Kansas City to Sedalia, but the posts did not get any response.  \nThen, a mail carrier, who had been notified by Rhonda Wirsig, who had helped search for the dog, found it about three miles east on Route V, Ozias said.  \nThe mail carrier notified Wirsig, who picked up the dog and returned it to Ozias, who contacted the rescue group.  \nThe rescue group picked up Jerry and took him to a veterinarian for evaluation.  \n“I don't believe he was out in the (Sunday) blizzard,” Ozias said. “Someone had him for a few days.”  \nThe dog did not have frostbite or other weather-related injuries, she said. “He was smelly and skinny, but had no injuries. He had been with people.”  \nThe dog was found, Ozias said, “because everyone in the community helped out,” by posting messages on Facebook, talking to others or actively searching for the dog.  \n“He survived walking on 13 Highway and walking in the woods,” she said, adding she does not believe the dog made it by himself to the location where he was found.  \n“There's no way the dog could have gone another three miles through the woods,” she said.  \nNeither person who picked up the dog contacted the animal shelter, which had been notified about the missing dog, she said.  \nWhile the shelter phone is not answered when the shelter is closed, central dispatch will take the information, she said.  \nPeople who find a lost animal also can look at the Facebook page Warrensburg Lost and Found Pets, Ozias said, to see if someone is looking for it. Someone will respond in seconds, she said, adding posts can be shared hundreds of times within an hour.  \n“I want people to know there are resources.” she said.\n\n\nEDIT: [picture from the article](https://imgur.com/a/pveEJBq)"", ""can't access the link in EU.

This is further explained in a paper published by the Yaqeen Institute:\n\n&gt; A careful reading of the full breadth of Islamic inheritance rulings rebuts the notion that the rulings privilege men. While women inherit less than men in four situations, they inherit more than men in 16 situations, and equal to men in 10 situations. Situations in which a woman receives more inheritance than a man include the case of a woman who dies leaving behind only a husband—in this case, the sisters of the mother of the deceased receive portions of the inheritance whereas the brothers of her father do not.\n\n…All instances in which there is a discrepancy between male and female heirs arise either due to a difference in proximity or rank of one’s relationship to the deceased, or based on one’s responsibility to financially provide for another. Given the larger system of financial responsibilities, the distribution of wealth was intended to equalize all recipients amongst the deceased’s family. All of Islām’s rulings must be understood as interconnected, where a woman has the legal right to be provided for (7).”', 'Good old Carthage.', 'Tunisian here and this bull shit on so many levels\n\n1 it was accepted by the president and proposed to the parliament. Only with their accord will it be law\n\n2 it\'s a controversial theme proposed in dire times to turn  people away from a failing government, it will not help neither women for men. No one will inherit anything if you don\'t have jack shit to inherit.\n\nIt\'s been 7 years since the revolution and it\'s never been worst than with this ""progressive"" government and it\'s only getting worse judging by it\'s priorities.', 'Lol why is this is written like a CK2 notification?', 'i went to Tunisia this year. half the women wore hijabs and the other half wore revealing clothes like short dresses and such. they were really beautiful and the men were treating them well, and not eyeing them or anything. i saw one young lady by herself driving a lambo. im sure its not completely equal in everything and needs work but compared to other Muslim countries its really progressive. ', 'As many people already said here, the reason why in Islam women inherit half of what men do is because men have the obligation to support the family financially, and women don\'t. Women are taken care of. They can work and keep their salary for themselves but in exchange they are in charge of the domestic life (house, kids, etc...). This is supposed to be a *just* arrangement, not an *equal* one, because: Islam is a religion of JUSTICE, not EQUALITY. \n\nNow as westerners we may have a problem with what Islam considers ""justice"" but that\'s their principle anyway. \n\nIslam is not necessarily bad for a woman... on the conditions that she is happy to play traditional gender roles and that she is happily married. Then Islam can provide for her a safe and advantageous environment. Think of the status of the white suburban American woman in the 50\'s (Mad Men\'s Betty Draper) , that\'s basically what Islam offers. Some women want this. \n\nNow the problem with Islam is that it doesn\'t tolerate deviation from the ""right path"". Liberated women, queer women, free thinking women, adventurous women, etc... who do not want to follow their traditional gender role can end up being completely hindered and oppressed by men under Islam. \n\nSo Islam doesn\'t necessarily treat women badly, but it doesn\'t liberate them either. Islam is the status quo for women: it\'s the gender role they\'ve been playing for centuries. And i would argue that where Islam fails the most is not by being old fashion and conservative, some women want this arrangement, it\'s that it doesn\'t give the choice to women: the choice to follow or not follow this arrangement. \n\nTl;dr: Islam is a restaurant that only serves one dish and doesn\'t allow you to choose anything else or eat elsewhere, the food is not necessarily bad but it\'s obviously not everybody\'s cup of tea. Some will love it, some will starve, but no one leaves. ', ""Oddly enough, Islam started with some of the more liberal ideals for women. Over time, because of their strict adherence to the Quran, they still stuck with those ideals as the rest of the world caught up and eventually surpassed them. It's good to see them start to catch up again, even if it's very slow."", 'To be fair.\nAccording to Sharia a man has to use his earned money for the household and even give some of his money to his wife (as pocket money or salary? She decides before the marriage how much she wants by the way) while a women is absolutely free to buy anything (helal) she wants with her money.\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/126316/is-the-husband-obliged-to-spend-on-his-wife-if-she-is-working-does-he-have-the-right-to-take-anything-of-her-salary\n\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/2686/if-a-woman-works-does-she-have-to-pay-the-household-expenses\n\n So it kind of makes sense that a man gets more but I am not familiar with inheritance law and I\'ve heard from someone who studies it that there are more cases in which a women gets more. But don\'t quote me on that. I sadly can\'t find the video in which this was said.\n\nAnd yes women are in fact allowed to work according to Islam.

Female professors in Universities which are made especially for women for example. \n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/106815/guidelines-on-women-working-outside-the-home\n\nSo it\'s not : "" You women, me man, I more worth""\n\nIt\'s a system that MIGHT seem to be unfair if we completely forget the really, really conservative fundament of the whole thing and the fact that men also need to compromise.', 'And should this be news in 2018?

There are multiple game studios with multinational reputations that are based in the UK, particularly Rockstar Games (the founder of the company, the Houser Brothers, are British; One of their flagship game studios - Rockstar North - based in Scotland, developed multiple Grand Theft Auto Games) and the establishment of such union could force game studios to look into the Crunch Time issue (a time when video game developers have to stay over time for weeks to deliver a game within its scheduled release date) and come up with a solution about it.\n\nJust roughly two months ago, Rockstar Games was embroiled in a controversy when one of its co-founder, Dan Houser, said that ""we were working 100-hour weeks"" on their forth coming Red Dead Redemption 2. Although Houser later clarified his statement that the 100-hour weeks were only limited to himself and three other writing team members over a period of ""weeks, not months"", and not all workers at Rockstar Games are like that, there were several anecdotal statements made by former Rockstar employees chronicling their hectic working experiences for the company, especially weeks before the release of a Triple-A title game which often subjects its workers to Crunch Time. There have been gradual improvements in terms of labor conditions for game industry workers (which should happen, by the way) and I hope the creation of UK gamer workers union would serve as a force for such. It could be a lot sooner, but its a start.\n\nIn a semi-related note, I think this is a good cause that gamers could really rally on. Gamers Rise Up.', 'About time.

Like most of the cases in Chinese history, the government didn\'t do this because they were progressive, or they cared, but because enough people were fed up and pushing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust because the western media rarely reports these pieces, just because there\'s no ""occupy Beijing"" movement doesn\'t mean all Chinese people are mindless drones. Perhaps it fits your narrative, and perhaps it\'s easier to believe that all Chinese people are sheep, that it\'s all the oppressive government\'s fault. But that\'s not the truth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe truth is ugly. The truth is that the government reflects the will of the people, and people, no matter if they\'re Chinese or American or European, are not simple creatures. China is embracing environmentalism because the people fought for it. China is pushing clean energy because people pushed for it. China is investing so much in infrastructure because people demanded it.  China got rid of the one-child policy because people clamored for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes - China is locking down Xinjiang because the people wanted it. China is increasing censorship because people shouted for it. Because Chinese people can be wonderfully progressive, amazing, and environmentalist, but they can also be racist fucking assholes. For thousands and thousands of years, the Chinese government has been put into place by the people, and torn down and replaced by the same people. This fact has not changed, and will not change. Americans and the Chinese are more similar than you give credit for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor you Americans, the power to challenge the regime has been theoretical - for 300 years, your government has been acceptable, and decent. Democracy offers you a lot more non-violent tools to make your voices heard. But you still have the underlying purpose of the second amendment, though that is nothing more than conceptual, since there was no need to put its purpose to task in the entire existence of America as a country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Chinese have been overthrowing governments every few hundred years. That power is not just conceptual, it\'s an inevitability. It has been part of the Chinese gene for thousands of years, since the time of Confucius and Mencius. Arguably, the Chinese government is (rightfully) more afraid of its people than the American government is afraid of theirs.', ""One problem, what is the source of the electricity?

This isn’t a cut and dry issue and honestly the disrespect to an industry that was absolutely vital to modern society is disgusting.\n\nIt is easy to sit back and criticize and dehumanize these miners but for most people they can’t even begin to comprehend their position. People working in mines range from 18-mid 60s (retirement ages vary) and the situations each are in are equally as diverse. A miner in their teens and early 20s can take training opportunities and flourish in many situations. As you increase the age the ability to retrain and make the wages they are used to diminish quickly. Part of that is due to how trying to enter a new industry works. Another important factor is mining communities are generally secluded, lack job diversity, and mines hold massive economic contributions not only to those communities but surrounding communities so now these people are having to uproot. Mix it all together and now you also have a flood of basic trained candidates flooding nearby communities all trying to compete for jobs. Every aspect economically is awful.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong I do support the reduction of coal and it is absolutely something that needs to be done. That however doesn’t mean the people or the industry need to be treated so terrible. Coal miners and really the mining industry in general have and continue to contribute tremendously. Without coal the industrial revolution would have never happened. Without that we would be living in a drastically different world. Mining in general feeds the necessary commodities for basic growth around the world. Disregarding that to completely villianize and toss away these people that are STILL working for a world that STILL needs them is disgusting and ignorant (ironically with how some of you talk).

She posted his p;ix on Facebook, Ozias said, but later brought the dog back and dumped him at a residence close to where she had found the dog.  \nUnfortunately, the occupants were not home, Ozias said.  \nOzias, vice president of the Warrensburg Cat Advocates, said members of the group went out and searched for the dog until 4 a.m., and the next day, community members who heard about the dog, searched the neighborhood and surrounding area looking for it without success.  \nThey then learned someone else had picked up the dog and had gone door-to-door in the Cedar Groves area trying to locate the owner. When the person was unable to find anyone to take the dog, it then was dumped again “in the middle of nowhere,” Ozias said.  \nShe said people in the community were sharing posts on social media from Kansas City to Sedalia, but the posts did not get any response.  \nThen, a mail carrier, who had been notified by Rhonda Wirsig, who had helped search for the dog, found it about three miles east on Route V, Ozias said.  \nThe mail carrier notified Wirsig, who picked up the dog and returned it to Ozias, who contacted the rescue group.  \nThe rescue group picked up Jerry and took him to a veterinarian for evaluation.  \n“I don't believe he was out in the (Sunday) blizzard,” Ozias said. “Someone had him for a few days.”  \nThe dog did not have frostbite or other weather-related injuries, she said. “He was smelly and skinny, but had no injuries. He had been with people.”  \nThe dog was found, Ozias said, “because everyone in the community helped out,” by posting messages on Facebook, talking to others or actively searching for the dog.  \n“He survived walking on 13 Highway and walking in the woods,” she said, adding she does not believe the dog made it by himself to the location where he was found.  \n“There's no way the dog could have gone another three miles through the woods,” she said.  \nNeither person who picked up the dog contacted the animal shelter, which had been notified about the missing dog, she said.  \nWhile the shelter phone is not answered when the shelter is closed, central dispatch will take the information, she said.  \nPeople who find a lost animal also can look at the Facebook page Warrensburg Lost and Found Pets, Ozias said, to see if someone is looking for it. Someone will respond in seconds, she said, adding posts can be shared hundreds of times within an hour.  \n“I want people to know there are resources.” she said.\n\n\nEDIT: [picture from the article](https://imgur.com/a/pveEJBq)"", ""can't access the link in EU.

This is further explained in a paper published by the Yaqeen Institute:\n\n&gt; A careful reading of the full breadth of Islamic inheritance rulings rebuts the notion that the rulings privilege men. While women inherit less than men in four situations, they inherit more than men in 16 situations, and equal to men in 10 situations. Situations in which a woman receives more inheritance than a man include the case of a woman who dies leaving behind only a husband—in this case, the sisters of the mother of the deceased receive portions of the inheritance whereas the brothers of her father do not.\n\n…All instances in which there is a discrepancy between male and female heirs arise either due to a difference in proximity or rank of one’s relationship to the deceased, or based on one’s responsibility to financially provide for another. Given the larger system of financial responsibilities, the distribution of wealth was intended to equalize all recipients amongst the deceased’s family. All of Islām’s rulings must be understood as interconnected, where a woman has the legal right to be provided for (7).”', 'Good old Carthage.', 'Tunisian here and this bull shit on so many levels\n\n1 it was accepted by the president and proposed to the parliament. Only with their accord will it be law\n\n2 it\'s a controversial theme proposed in dire times to turn  people away from a failing government, it will not help neither women for men. No one will inherit anything if you don\'t have jack shit to inherit.\n\nIt\'s been 7 years since the revolution and it\'s never been worst than with this ""progressive"" government and it\'s only getting worse judging by it\'s priorities.', 'Lol why is this is written like a CK2 notification?', 'i went to Tunisia this year. half the women wore hijabs and the other half wore revealing clothes like short dresses and such. they were really beautiful and the men were treating them well, and not eyeing them or anything. i saw one young lady by herself driving a lambo. im sure its not completely equal in everything and needs work but compared to other Muslim countries its really progressive. ', 'As many people already said here, the reason why in Islam women inherit half of what men do is because men have the obligation to support the family financially, and women don\'t. Women are taken care of. They can work and keep their salary for themselves but in exchange they are in charge of the domestic life (house, kids, etc...). This is supposed to be a *just* arrangement, not an *equal* one, because: Islam is a religion of JUSTICE, not EQUALITY. \n\nNow as westerners we may have a problem with what Islam considers ""justice"" but that\'s their principle anyway. \n\nIslam is not necessarily bad for a woman... on the conditions that she is happy to play traditional gender roles and that she is happily married. Then Islam can provide for her a safe and advantageous environment. Think of the status of the white suburban American woman in the 50\'s (Mad Men\'s Betty Draper) , that\'s basically what Islam offers. Some women want this. \n\nNow the problem with Islam is that it doesn\'t tolerate deviation from the ""right path"". Liberated women, queer women, free thinking women, adventurous women, etc... who do not want to follow their traditional gender role can end up being completely hindered and oppressed by men under Islam. \n\nSo Islam doesn\'t necessarily treat women badly, but it doesn\'t liberate them either. Islam is the status quo for women: it\'s the gender role they\'ve been playing for centuries. And i would argue that where Islam fails the most is not by being old fashion and conservative, some women want this arrangement, it\'s that it doesn\'t give the choice to women: the choice to follow or not follow this arrangement. \n\nTl;dr: Islam is a restaurant that only serves one dish and doesn\'t allow you to choose anything else or eat elsewhere, the food is not necessarily bad but it\'s obviously not everybody\'s cup of tea. Some will love it, some will starve, but no one leaves. ', ""Oddly enough, Islam started with some of the more liberal ideals for women. Over time, because of their strict adherence to the Quran, they still stuck with those ideals as the rest of the world caught up and eventually surpassed them. It's good to see them start to catch up again, even if it's very slow."", 'To be fair.\nAccording to Sharia a man has to use his earned money for the household and even give some of his money to his wife (as pocket money or salary? She decides before the marriage how much she wants by the way) while a women is absolutely free to buy anything (helal) she wants with her money.\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/126316/is-the-husband-obliged-to-spend-on-his-wife-if-she-is-working-does-he-have-the-right-to-take-anything-of-her-salary\n\n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/2686/if-a-woman-works-does-she-have-to-pay-the-household-expenses\n\n So it kind of makes sense that a man gets more but I am not familiar with inheritance law and I\'ve heard from someone who studies it that there are more cases in which a women gets more. But don\'t quote me on that. I sadly can\'t find the video in which this was said.\n\nAnd yes women are in fact allowed to work according to Islam.

Female professors in Universities which are made especially for women for example. \n\nhttps://islamqa.info/en/answers/106815/guidelines-on-women-working-outside-the-home\n\nSo it\'s not : "" You women, me man, I more worth""\n\nIt\'s a system that MIGHT seem to be unfair if we completely forget the really, really conservative fundament of the whole thing and the fact that men also need to compromise.', 'And should this be news in 2018?
