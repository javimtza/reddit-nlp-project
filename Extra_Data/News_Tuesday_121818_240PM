""No surprise we have work life that is unstable &amp; low paying.""\n\nI wonder if Republicans will finally admit supply-side/trickle-down is a fantasy?', 'OFFS... so much ignorance on this topic. Okay, let\'s do this thing. \n\nFirst off, a stock buyback is when a company decides \'yanno what, I\'ve got too much stock out there\', then goes and buys their own stock back from shareholders. There\'s several reasons why they would want to do this. First, it makes them less vulnerable to a hostile takeover since less stock is out there to get that crucial 51%. Second, it drives up the price of remaining stock, because there is less of it out there, and presumably the same demand, which can be seen as a benefit for the shareholder. \n\nBasically, they aren\'t \'giving out\' squat. They are literally buying back stock previously issued. They want to become more solvent, and have less stock floating around. Some companies do this before going private, some companies always have this in their business model. ""Okay, we are in kind of a pickle right now, let\'s issue some stock, then in five years, we buy it back"", basically using the newly issued stock as more of a loan, with the company\'s solvency as the collateral. There are lots of reasons why a company would want to conduct a buyback. \n\nGenerally, a company buying their own stock back means that they don\'t need the extra capital at the moment, which is the sign of a healthy company. That is why it is generally seen as a sign of a strong market to have many of the big players in the market conducting buybacks. \n\nHowever, it can also be an indicator of uncertainty in the market. A company who is concerned about the volatility of their stock might conduct a buyback in order to reduce the exposure to a stock market fluctuation. If you have less stock out there, you are less exposed to stock fluctuations affecting your core business. This is probably closer to what is going on right now. \n\nLet\'s play out a hypothetical conversation in a board room somewhere, OverSimplified style.\n\nCEO: So, how much do we have in stocks floating around?\n\nCFO: Five hundred million issued.\n\nCEO: And of that five hundred million, how many are owned by people working for our company, as in our executives who have a vested interest in not selling it?\n\nCFO: Bout... hmm... hundred and fifty million. \n\nCEO: So we have 350 million stocks just floating around out there?\n\nCFO: Yep.\n\nCEO: So, what\'s our stock price look like?\n\nCFO: At the moment? Rockin\' around a hundred bucks a share\n\nCEO: So at this time, we have 3.5 BILLION dollars worth of stocks out there?\n\nCFO: Yep! That\'s 3.5 billion dollars we are able to play with, but which belong to someone else.\n\nCEO: Yea, but what if one of our competitors decides to go snap up a controlling share?\n\nCFO: Uhhh... we\'d probably be re-branding everything. And the board, that\'s us personally, would probably be out of a job. \n\nCEO: Can we afford to buy back, saaaay... couple hundred thousand shares?\n\nCFO: Be tight, but sure... we can do that. \n\nCEO: Do it. I like my decor, and I like my job. I don\'t want someone else getting it. \n\nHaving worked for a major Stock Transfer Agent for several years, this is not the sky falling. I have assisted with and helped conduct buybacks before. The only difference between a buyback and any other time when people trade stock is that instead of another broker or individual buying the stock, it is the company who issued it in the first place buying it, and then not re-distributing it.

It employed about 950 people, including 500 in Missouri.\n\nIn November, the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges voted to revoke Vatterott\'s accreditation, ruling that the school failed to demonstrate successful student achievement.\n\nVatterott\'s potential buyer has had its own financial problems. Education Corporation of America announced this month that it too was shuttering all campuses nationwide, after its accrediting agency suspended approval.

It was for violation that did break military regulations, but the commander didn\'t want to send up the person to be formally punished in a court of law (well, court martial). \n\nThere were set limits to how much the commanding officer could punish those they found guilty. The max punishment for this is usually 45 days restriction (can\'t leave ship or certain region of base without permission) and 45 days extra duties (2 hours per day except Sunday and Holidays, though they counted against the days required). Think of it as being only allowed to live in your house and work at your work place and go to your place of worship. There\'s also a 1/2 month pay for two months forfeiture. \n\nHowever, there\'s that ""Or"" which is confinement on bread and water for max of three days. Basically, you\'d be in jail for three days. It\'d be the equivalent of solitary confinement seeing as no one else would be there most likely. Also, the person couldn\'t be given both punishments, just one or the other.\n\nI\'ve never seen anyone given the bread and water punishment. However, one of my commanding officers offered the later as an option if someone wanted to trade. I don\'t think anyone took the offer but could be wrong. Only people E-3 and below could even have that as an option anyway.\n\nBasically, getting rid of this option changes little. Most commanders never offered it.

"", 'A big contributor is that obese parents are leading their children into bad eating habits which will carry on through their adulthood.\n\nI’m obese and trying to lose weight as an 18 yr old. I lost 20 lbs this semester just because I didn’t grab seconds at the dining hall and mostly avoided buying bags of chips or boxes of cookies (which I usually ate within a day or two). Growing up, I was always encouraged to grab more food, and it felt rude not to. Now I use a smaller plate in the dining hall, and after I eat a normal sized meal, I feel full.\n\nAlso, a lot of these people use food as a coping mechanism. And I’ve done that a lot too. “It’s okay to buy this junk food. I have a lot of assignments, and I deserve it.” Yeah, I would’ve lost a lot more if I didn’t heavily fall back into that during midterms and finals.\n\nI always remember growing up my doctors were shocked that I was so big yet didn’t drink anything other than water or non-fat milk. But my parents hated cooking, so multiple times a week they’d just grab McDonalds, pizza, etc. Maybe I didn’t get fat from drinking calories, but I sure did from never eating at home.\n\nSo, being home at Christmas time is pretty difficult this year. I ate two bowls of soup the other day and felt pretty sick and tired afterwards from eating way too much, so at least I’m noticing small changes. But most people don’t get the chance to notice these problems in their eating habits.\n\nWhen you’ve been raised to eat a certain way, it’s hard to change.

There might have been less than a dozen fat kids in my elementary school book and not much more than that in my high school books.

Everything is far away, and everything is connected by streets. There are no proper public transport systems aside from in very major cities. There are very few sidewalks, even in suburban neighborhoods where children live, making it that much harder to get to where you need to go.\nEdit: I forgot a part. All of the above means that almost no one has the opportunity to walk to work or school or the grocery store.

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

When they gave everyone the raise we were told we would get bumped up to $11/hr *plus* a bonus based on how long we had been with the company. A few days before that bonus was supposed to show up in our paychecks we were told that the company had ""changed their mind"" and employees would have to decide if they wanted the raise or the bonus, but not both.\n\nHere\'s the kicker. Walmart claimed that the raise was part of the Trump tax cut, but they had been taking about the raise for months before the tax cuts. \n\nSo After Christmas, I decided to switch stores to be closer to where I was living. Walmart cut my pay to $10.00/hr for two weeks then bumped me up to $11. After that, employee hours dropped and I had to find a new job because yes, I was making $11/hr, but only getting 11 hours a week. That is standard operating procedure for Walmart.

""No surprise we have work life that is unstable &amp; low paying.""\n\nI wonder if Republicans will finally admit supply-side/trickle-down is a fantasy?', 'OFFS... so much ignorance on this topic. Okay, let\'s do this thing. \n\nFirst off, a stock buyback is when a company decides \'yanno what, I\'ve got too much stock out there\', then goes and buys their own stock back from shareholders. There\'s several reasons why they would want to do this. First, it makes them less vulnerable to a hostile takeover since less stock is out there to get that crucial 51%. Second, it drives up the price of remaining stock, because there is less of it out there, and presumably the same demand, which can be seen as a benefit for the shareholder. \n\nBasically, they aren\'t \'giving out\' squat. They are literally buying back stock previously issued. They want to become more solvent, and have less stock floating around. Some companies do this before going private, some companies always have this in their business model. ""Okay, we are in kind of a pickle right now, let\'s issue some stock, then in five years, we buy it back"", basically using the newly issued stock as more of a loan, with the company\'s solvency as the collateral. There are lots of reasons why a company would want to conduct a buyback. \n\nGenerally, a company buying their own stock back means that they don\'t need the extra capital at the moment, which is the sign of a healthy company. That is why it is generally seen as a sign of a strong market to have many of the big players in the market conducting buybacks. \n\nHowever, it can also be an indicator of uncertainty in the market. A company who is concerned about the volatility of their stock might conduct a buyback in order to reduce the exposure to a stock market fluctuation. If you have less stock out there, you are less exposed to stock fluctuations affecting your core business. This is probably closer to what is going on right now. \n\nLet\'s play out a hypothetical conversation in a board room somewhere, OverSimplified style.\n\nCEO: So, how much do we have in stocks floating around?\n\nCFO: Five hundred million issued.\n\nCEO: And of that five hundred million, how many are owned by people working for our company, as in our executives who have a vested interest in not selling it?\n\nCFO: Bout... hmm... hundred and fifty million. \n\nCEO: So we have 350 million stocks just floating around out there?\n\nCFO: Yep.\n\nCEO: So, what\'s our stock price look like?\n\nCFO: At the moment? Rockin\' around a hundred bucks a share\n\nCEO: So at this time, we have 3.5 BILLION dollars worth of stocks out there?\n\nCFO: Yep! That\'s 3.5 billion dollars we are able to play with, but which belong to someone else.\n\nCEO: Yea, but what if one of our competitors decides to go snap up a controlling share?\n\nCFO: Uhhh... we\'d probably be re-branding everything. And the board, that\'s us personally, would probably be out of a job. \n\nCEO: Can we afford to buy back, saaaay... couple hundred thousand shares?\n\nCFO: Be tight, but sure... we can do that. \n\nCEO: Do it. I like my decor, and I like my job. I don\'t want someone else getting it. \n\nHaving worked for a major Stock Transfer Agent for several years, this is not the sky falling. I have assisted with and helped conduct buybacks before. The only difference between a buyback and any other time when people trade stock is that instead of another broker or individual buying the stock, it is the company who issued it in the first place buying it, and then not re-distributing it.

LOUIS — A for-profit college that operates several Midwestern campuses has suddenly closed, citing mounting financial problems.\n\nVatterott Education Centers closed on Monday. In a letter to students, the suburban St. Louis-based college cited a U.S. Department of Education decision to limit Vatterott\'s participation in federal financial aid programs.\n\n""Vatterott is unable to continue operation under these restrictions, and consequently, is unable to complete the aforementioned sale,"" the letter stated. ""The Department imposed these restrictions despite the presence of an interested buyer and our clear communication that such restrictions would result in the school\'s closure.""\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the federal agency\'s decision doomed a pending sale of most of Vatterott\'s campuses to another for-profit education company, Education Corporation of America . It also closed its campuses this month.\n\nVatterott operated 15 campuses specializing in culinary arts, automotive trades, allied health and music production, among other areas. It employed about 950 people, including 500 in Missouri.\n\nIn November, the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges voted to revoke Vatterott\'s accreditation, ruling that the school failed to demonstrate successful student achievement.\n\nVatterott\'s potential buyer has had its own financial problems. Education Corporation of America announced this month that it too was shuttering all campuses nationwide, after its accrediting agency suspended approval. One of the largest for-profit college chains in the U.S., it had enrolled roughly 20,000 students across more than 70 campuses.\n\nLegal documents said Education Corporation of America was unable to make payments on its debt and rental fees due to declining student enrollment. It faced eviction at several campuses.\n\nVatterott officials told students they were working to store their permanent records and identify other schools that could accept them on transfer.']",2

It was for violation that did break military regulations, but the commander didn\'t want to send up the person to be formally punished in a court of law (well, court martial). \n\nThere were set limits to how much the commanding officer could punish those they found guilty. The max punishment for this is usually 45 days restriction (can\'t leave ship or certain region of base without permission) and 45 days extra duties (2 hours per day except Sunday and Holidays, though they counted against the days required).

It\'d be the equivalent of solitary confinement seeing as no one else would be there most likely. Also, the person couldn\'t be given both punishments, just one or the other.\n\nI\'ve never seen anyone given the bread and water punishment. However, one of my commanding officers offered the later as an option if someone wanted to trade. I don\'t think anyone took the offer but could be wrong. Only people E-3 and below could even have that as an option anyway.\n\nBasically, getting rid of this option changes little. Most commanders never offered it.

Growing up, I was always encouraged to grab more food, and it felt rude not to. Now I use a smaller plate in the dining hall, and after I eat a normal sized meal, I feel full.\n\nAlso, a lot of these people use food as a coping mechanism.

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

When they gave everyone the raise we were told we would get bumped up to $11/hr *plus* a bonus based on how long we had been with the company. A few days before that bonus was supposed to show up in our paychecks we were told that the company had ""changed their mind"" and employees would have to decide if they wanted the raise or the bonus, but not both.\n\nHere\'s the kicker. Walmart claimed that the raise was part of the Trump tax cut, but they had been taking about the raise for months before the tax cuts. \n\nSo After Christmas, I decided to switch stores to be closer to where I was living. Walmart cut my pay to $10.00/hr for two weeks then bumped me up to $11. After that, employee hours dropped and I had to find a new job because yes, I was making $11/hr, but only getting 11 hours a week. That is standard operating procedure for Walmart.

Later that day the general manager spoke with me about the manager job and why I felt I should be fit for it.

He told me I was the most knowledgeable about that department and I have the ability to run it ""smoothly"" That night I put in so many jobs applications.

Because corporations have been using the vast amount of money saved on labor costs thanks to globalization that they can afford to prop up their own stock price.  \n\nThis is well known in financial circles, especially the huge increase in buyback activity since Trump entered office.  But this is the first time I’ve seen it spun by the press as a positive indicator, let alone twisted and mangled into a lie that this is for the investor.  If they were actually offering up this new type of dividend because they cared about shareholders they’d do it when the price goes up.', 'jesus look at the data over a 15 year period.

Good discount this week to complete some buybacks.', '&gt; While companies spent heavily on buybacks after the tax law was enacted, investments in job-creating plants and equipment has been more mixed. One measure of business spending, real nonresidential fixed investment, climbed 11.5% in the first quarter of 2018 before sharply decelerating. That metric slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter, compared with 3.4% during the third quarter of 2017.\n\nAnd\n\n&gt; ""When [a] corporation uses profits for stock buy back it\'s deciding that returning capital to shareholders is better for business than investing in their products or workers,"" Rubio said. ""No surprise we have work life that is unstable &amp; low paying.""\n\nI wonder if Republicans will finally admit supply-side/trickle-down is a fantasy?', 'OFFS... so much ignorance on this topic. Okay, let\'s do this thing. \n\nFirst off, a stock buyback is when a company decides \'yanno what, I\'ve got too much stock out there\', then goes and buys their own stock back from shareholders. There\'s several reasons why they would want to do this. First, it makes them less vulnerable to a hostile takeover since less stock is out there to get that crucial 51%. Second, it drives up the price of remaining stock, because there is less of it out there, and presumably the same demand, which can be seen as a benefit for the shareholder. \n\nBasically, they aren\'t \'giving out\' squat. They are literally buying back stock previously issued. They want to become more solvent, and have less stock floating around. Some companies do this before going private, some companies always have this in their business model. ""Okay, we are in kind of a pickle right now, let\'s issue some stock, then in five years, we buy it back"", basically using the newly issued stock as more of a loan, with the company\'s solvency as the collateral. There are lots of reasons why a company would want to conduct a buyback. \n\nGenerally, a company buying their own stock back means that they don\'t need the extra capital at the moment, which is the sign of a healthy company. That is why it is generally seen as a sign of a strong market to have many of the big players in the market conducting buybacks. \n\nHowever, it can also be an indicator of uncertainty in the market. A company who is concerned about the volatility of their stock might conduct a buyback in order to reduce the exposure to a stock market fluctuation. If you have less stock out there, you are less exposed to stock fluctuations affecting your core business. This is probably closer to what is going on right now. \n\nLet\'s play out a hypothetical conversation in a board room somewhere, OverSimplified style.\n\nCEO: So, how much do we have in stocks floating around?\n\nCFO: Five hundred million issued.\n\nCEO: And of that five hundred million, how many are owned by people working for our company, as in our executives who have a vested interest in not selling it?\n\nCFO: Bout... hmm... hundred and fifty million. \n\nCEO: So we have 350 million stocks just floating around out there?\n\nCFO: Yep.\n\nCEO: So, what\'s our stock price look like?\n\nCFO: At the moment? Rockin\' around a hundred bucks a share\n\nCEO: So at this time, we have 3.5 BILLION dollars worth of stocks out there?\n\nCFO: Yep! That\'s 3.5 billion dollars we are able to play with, but which belong to someone else.\n\nCEO: Yea, but what if one of our competitors decides to go snap up a controlling share?\n\nCFO: Uhhh... we\'d probably be re-branding everything. And the board, that\'s us personally, would probably be out of a job. \n\nCEO: Can we afford to buy back, saaaay... couple hundred thousand shares?\n\nCFO: Be tight, but sure... we can do that. \n\nCEO: Do it. I like my decor, and I like my job. I don\'t want someone else getting it. \n\nHaving worked for a major Stock Transfer Agent for several years, this is not the sky falling. I have assisted with and helped conduct buybacks before. The only difference between a buyback and any other time when people trade stock is that instead of another broker or individual buying the stock, it is the company who issued it in the first place buying it, and then not re-distributing it.

I lost 20 lbs this semester just because I didn’t grab seconds at the dining hall and mostly avoided buying bags of chips or boxes of cookies (which I usually ate within a day or two). Growing up, I was always encouraged to grab more food, and it felt rude not to. Now I use a smaller plate in the dining hall, and after I eat a normal sized meal, I feel full.\n\nAlso, a lot of these people use food as a coping mechanism. And I’ve done that a lot too. “It’s okay to buy this junk food. I have a lot of assignments, and I deserve it.” Yeah, I would’ve lost a lot more if I didn’t heavily fall back into that during midterms and finals.\n\nI always remember growing up my doctors were shocked that I was so big yet didn’t drink anything other than water or non-fat milk. But my parents hated cooking, so multiple times a week they’d just grab McDonalds, pizza, etc. Maybe I didn’t get fat from drinking calories, but I sure did from never eating at home.\n\nSo, being home at Christmas time is pretty difficult this year. I ate two bowls of soup the other day and felt pretty sick and tired afterwards from eating way too much, so at least I’m noticing small changes. But most people don’t get the chance to notice these problems in their eating habits.\n\nWhen you’ve been raised to eat a certain way, it’s hard to change. Obese parents are raising obese kids who are turning into obese adults. I don’t think this trend will be broken anytime soon.

Everything is far away, and everything is connected by streets. There are no proper public transport systems aside from in very major cities. There are very few sidewalks, even in suburban neighborhoods where children live, making it that much harder to get to where you need to go.\nEdit: I forgot a part.

While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it.

Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil.

""No surprise we have work life that is unstable &amp; low paying.""\n\nI wonder if Republicans will finally admit supply-side/trickle-down is a fantasy?', 'OFFS... so much ignorance on this topic. Okay, let\'s do this thing. \n\nFirst off, a stock buyback is when a company decides \'yanno what, I\'ve got too much stock out there\', then goes and buys their own stock back from shareholders. There\'s several reasons why they would want to do this. First, it makes them less vulnerable to a hostile takeover since less stock is out there to get that crucial 51%. Second, it drives up the price of remaining stock, because there is less of it out there, and presumably the same demand, which can be seen as a benefit for the shareholder. \n\nBasically, they aren\'t \'giving out\' squat. They are literally buying back stock previously issued. They want to become more solvent, and have less stock floating around. Some companies do this before going private, some companies always have this in their business model. ""Okay, we are in kind of a pickle right now, let\'s issue some stock, then in five years, we buy it back"", basically using the newly issued stock as more of a loan, with the company\'s solvency as the collateral. There are lots of reasons why a company would want to conduct a buyback. \n\nGenerally, a company buying their own stock back means that they don\'t need the extra capital at the moment, which is the sign of a healthy company. That is why it is generally seen as a sign of a strong market to have many of the big players in the market conducting buybacks. \n\nHowever, it can also be an indicator of uncertainty in the market. A company who is concerned about the volatility of their stock might conduct a buyback in order to reduce the exposure to a stock market fluctuation. If you have less stock out there, you are less exposed to stock fluctuations affecting your core business. This is probably closer to what is going on right now. \n\nLet\'s play out a hypothetical conversation in a board room somewhere, OverSimplified style.\n\nCEO: So, how much do we have in stocks floating around?\n\nCFO: Five hundred million issued.\n\nCEO: And of that five hundred million, how many are owned by people working for our company, as in our executives who have a vested interest in not selling it?\n\nCFO: Bout... hmm... hundred and fifty million. \n\nCEO: So we have 350 million stocks just floating around out there?\n\nCFO: Yep.\n\nCEO: So, what\'s our stock price look like?\n\nCFO: At the moment? Rockin\' around a hundred bucks a share\n\nCEO: So at this time, we have 3.5 BILLION dollars worth of stocks out there?\n\nCFO: Yep! That\'s 3.5 billion dollars we are able to play with, but which belong to someone else.\n\nCEO: Yea, but what if one of our competitors decides to go snap up a controlling share?\n\nCFO: Uhhh... we\'d probably be re-branding everything. And the board, that\'s us personally, would probably be out of a job. \n\nCEO: Can we afford to buy back, saaaay... couple hundred thousand shares?\n\nCFO: Be tight, but sure... we can do that. \n\nCEO: Do it. I like my decor, and I like my job. I don\'t want someone else getting it. \n\nHaving worked for a major Stock Transfer Agent for several years, this is not the sky falling. I have assisted with and helped conduct buybacks before. The only difference between a buyback and any other time when people trade stock is that instead of another broker or individual buying the stock, it is the company who issued it in the first place buying it, and then not re-distributing it.

"", ""The problem I have with this story and the problem I have had from the beginning is how quickly everybody latched onto the narrative that this girl died in U.S. custody. Yes, authorities are responsible for anybody in their custody but the suggestion that border patrol would mistreat a young girl, putting her life in danger, and allowing her condition to decline to the point where she died in their custody on purpose or as a result of negligence is highly irresponsible. There is no way this girl was in good health if she died within 8 hours of border patrol taking her into custody. Unless there is foul play, or a medical examiner suggest there are signs of neglect, I don't understand how anybody can believe border patrol is responsible for this girl's death. She almost certainly would have died if they didn't pick her up. Everybody wants blame to go around, but it's very obvious this poor young girl was in very bad condition from the journey. We should be using this as an example of the hardship and peril these people are going through in order to seek protection and a better life we should not be using her death to score political points.

That ship had about a 65% adult obesity rate. \n\nSaddest part was all of the obese kids being allowed nonstop soda and pizza and they weren't taking part in any of the activities. Should be considered child abuse. "", 'A big contributor is that obese parents are leading their children into bad eating habits which will carry on through their adulthood.\n\nI’m obese and trying to lose weight as an 18 yr old. I lost 20 lbs this semester just because I didn’t grab seconds at the dining hall and mostly avoided buying bags of chips or boxes of cookies (which I usually ate within a day or two). Growing up, I was always encouraged to grab more food, and it felt rude not to. Now I use a smaller plate in the dining hall, and after I eat a normal sized meal, I feel full.\n\nAlso, a lot of these people use food as a coping mechanism. And I’ve done that a lot too. “It’s okay to buy this junk food. I have a lot of assignments, and I deserve it.” Yeah, I would’ve lost a lot more if I didn’t heavily fall back into that during midterms and finals.\n\nI always remember growing up my doctors were shocked that I was so big yet didn’t drink anything other than water or non-fat milk. But my parents hated cooking, so multiple times a week they’d just grab McDonalds, pizza, etc. Maybe I didn’t get fat from drinking calories, but I sure did from never eating at home.\n\nSo, being home at Christmas time is pretty difficult this year. I ate two bowls of soup the other day and felt pretty sick and tired afterwards from eating way too much, so at least I’m noticing small changes. But most people don’t get the chance to notice these problems in their eating habits.\n\nWhen you’ve been raised to eat a certain way, it’s hard to change. Obese parents are raising obese kids who are turning into obese adults. I don’t think this trend will be broken anytime soon. Breaking someone’s bad eating habits is extremely difficult and is a long (but necessary) process. It’s a slow change, and like most things, people aren’t going to be willing to do it.', ""Lots of comments here in all different directions. That said, it's a striking difference to me how many fat kids there are as well (usually with fat parents). I was recently cleaning out my attic and came across my old high school yearbooks and even my elementary school yearbooks (yes, we had them but they were just small plastic bound things). There might have been less than a dozen fat kids in my elementary school book and not much more than that in my high school books. My high school was very mixed economically too, not just middle-class kids. It certainly is quite a contrast with the kids I see today. I graduated high school in 1980. "", 'I work at a gas station.

But there\'s two additional problems I don\'t see people discussing very much.\n\n\n1) America is massive and connected only by roads and highways. Everything is far away, and everything is connected by streets. There are no proper public transport systems aside from in very major cities. There are very few sidewalks, even in suburban neighborhoods where children live, making it that much harder to get to where you need to go.\nEdit: I forgot a part. All of the above means that almost no one has the opportunity to walk to work or school or the grocery store. Even 20 minutes of mandatory walking a day would be great for people, but they can\'t even have that.\n\n\n2) People don\'t know how to cook. This is a broad generalization, I know, but the amount of people - not just young people, but real life adults with families - who were never sat down and taught how to cook, is crazy. I don\'t mean just following a recipe, but knowing how to chop certain vegetables, how to cook certain kinds of meat, how to make a basic sauce - a lot of people don\'t know this stuff.

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

The was no one as fiercely democratic as him. \n\nMy grandfather observed that the only vets on the trip who were Trump supporters didn’t see combat. He brought this up with Sinise over one of the dinners and the two of them had a brief but beautiful conversation about the change in American’s sense of self possession as a united country since the end of the Second World War. I found Sinise to be open minded, thoughtful, kind and giving. He articulated a political position that was undeniably conservative, but a type of conservatism that wasn’t about hating the poor or the less powerful and he flatly rejected Trumpian division as un-American. \n\nHe may just be a goofy actor with a lot of money and a weird hobby, but he absolutely gave my grandfather and me a gift that I will be thankful for for the rest of my life.

""No surprise we have work life that is unstable &amp; low paying.""\n\nI wonder if Republicans will finally admit supply-side/trickle-down is a fantasy?', 'OFFS... so much ignorance on this topic. Okay, let\'s do this thing. \n\nFirst off, a stock buyback is when a company decides \'yanno what, I\'ve got too much stock out there\', then goes and buys their own stock back from shareholders. There\'s several reasons why they would want to do this. First, it makes them less vulnerable to a hostile takeover since less stock is out there to get that crucial 51%. Second, it drives up the price of remaining stock, because there is less of it out there, and presumably the same demand, which can be seen as a benefit for the shareholder. \n\nBasically, they aren\'t \'giving out\' squat. They are literally buying back stock previously issued. They want to become more solvent, and have less stock floating around. Some companies do this before going private, some companies always have this in their business model. ""Okay, we are in kind of a pickle right now, let\'s issue some stock, then in five years, we buy it back"", basically using the newly issued stock as more of a loan, with the company\'s solvency as the collateral. There are lots of reasons why a company would want to conduct a buyback. \n\nGenerally, a company buying their own stock back means that they don\'t need the extra capital at the moment, which is the sign of a healthy company. That is why it is generally seen as a sign of a strong market to have many of the big players in the market conducting buybacks. \n\nHowever, it can also be an indicator of uncertainty in the market. A company who is concerned about the volatility of their stock might conduct a buyback in order to reduce the exposure to a stock market fluctuation. If you have less stock out there, you are less exposed to stock fluctuations affecting your core business. This is probably closer to what is going on right now. \n\nLet\'s play out a hypothetical conversation in a board room somewhere, OverSimplified style.\n\nCEO: So, how much do we have in stocks floating around?\n\nCFO: Five hundred million issued.\n\nCEO: And of that five hundred million, how many are owned by people working for our company, as in our executives who have a vested interest in not selling it?\n\nCFO: Bout... hmm... hundred and fifty million. \n\nCEO: So we have 350 million stocks just floating around out there?\n\nCFO: Yep.\n\nCEO: So, what\'s our stock price look like?\n\nCFO: At the moment? Rockin\' around a hundred bucks a share\n\nCEO: So at this time, we have 3.5 BILLION dollars worth of stocks out there?\n\nCFO: Yep! That\'s 3.5 billion dollars we are able to play with, but which belong to someone else.\n\nCEO: Yea, but what if one of our competitors decides to go snap up a controlling share?\n\nCFO: Uhhh... we\'d probably be re-branding everything. And the board, that\'s us personally, would probably be out of a job. \n\nCEO: Can we afford to buy back, saaaay... couple hundred thousand shares?\n\nCFO: Be tight, but sure... we can do that. \n\nCEO: Do it. I like my decor, and I like my job. I don\'t want someone else getting it. \n\nHaving worked for a major Stock Transfer Agent for several years, this is not the sky falling. I have assisted with and helped conduct buybacks before. The only difference between a buyback and any other time when people trade stock is that instead of another broker or individual buying the stock, it is the company who issued it in the first place buying it, and then not re-distributing it.

Education Corporation of America announced this month that it too was shuttering all campuses nationwide, after its accrediting agency suspended approval.
