Instead, it focused almost entirely on criminalizing addiction, passing laws to lock up people who use drugs and drug dealers through exorbitant prison sentences, such as mandatory minimums — an approach that many policymakers, including some Republicans, now consider a mistake and are looking to undo. As a result, the US never got the treatment system it needs to deal with these crises.*\n\n\n*Today, white Americans are the ones disproportionately suffering in the opioid crisis. The largely empathetic rhetorical response to their addiction, compared with the way black people addicted to crack were treated decades ago, has been noted many times over.

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

He articulated a political position that was undeniably conservative, but a type of conservatism that wasn’t about hating the poor or the less powerful and he flatly rejected Trumpian division as un-American. \n\nHe may just be a goofy actor with a lot of money and a weird hobby, but he absolutely gave my grandfather and me a gift that I will be thankful for for the rest of my life.

It\'s just a law requiring people to buy something.\n\n8. The Supreme Court already said you can\'t do that. That\'s why they renamed the penalty a tax.

We\'d have my family coverage, but only until she\'s 26... another clause of the ACA.\n\nBut ... honestly ... and I say this as a diehard limited government fiscal conservative... universal healthcare would be better than the absolute mess of the ACA.\n\nThe Obama administration thought the ACA would be a good compromise.  The people wanted the pre-existing conditions clause and jobless, aimless millenials needed their parents health coverage until they were almost 30.\n\nThis was going to force the industry to take a pretty sizable financial hit and, believe it or not, the government actually doesn\'t want to regulate the profitability of an industry if they don\'t have to.

Reduce the financial burden and mitigate the risks by requiring *everybody* - even the healthy people - to carry insurance. Or pay a financial penalty if they don\'t carry insurance. Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working.

It\'s a fee the government was forcing citizens to pay.  *It is a friggin\' tax.*\n\nNow, I can like taxes or not like taxes, but the fact is that Congress can make new taxes, so that\'s that. Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility.

You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.

Clark Jr., 30, from Bloomingdale, has been charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine. According to court filings, the FBI received a tip-off from Clark’s family shortly after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. The family said that Jeffrey and his brother Edward — who committed suicide shortly after the Pittsburgh attack — were heavily involved in the so-called “alt-right” movement and knew the suspected Pittsburgh Synagogue shooter Robert Bowers through the far-right-friendly social media site Gab.\n\n&gt;Jeffrey Clark’s accounts on Gab give a true taste of the type of violent, neo-Nazi rhetoric he was spewing, as well as his potential capacity for violence. As HuffPost reported, on Gab Clark called himself “**DC Bowl Gang**,” a reference to the bowl-cut Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. As the court affidavit noted, the FBI’s investigation of Bowers had revealed that he was “friends” on Gab with Jeffrey Clark.\n\nThe mass killer also has friends in politics.\n\n&gt;Ever since Paul Nehlen(R)’s white supremacist beliefs were exposed last year, the Wisconsin also-ran has slid further and further into irrelevancy — and has become increasingly unhinged in the process. Nehlen moved from The Right Stuff’s Fash the Nation podcast to The David Duke Show to Christopher Cantwell’s Radical Agenda.\n\n&gt;And on April 19, 2018 he took things even further by appearing on a Neo-Nazi program called the **Bowlcast** — a low-rent podcast which borrows its name from the hairstyle sported by Dylann Roof, who, three years ago, gunned down nine black parishioners in cold blood.\n\nI summarized:\n\n**There is a right wing white nationalist terror movement active in the U.S. which has already resulted in numerous deaths.

If he had not gone directly to the EEOC I wonder if his murder would have been solved with as much understanding of the motives and context surrounding it. Have to wonder what, if anything, the company was doing about the situation once they were notified.\n\n&gt;The investigation began with the Aug. 19, 2017 death of Eliud Montoya, 41, who was found shot to death near his home in Garden City, Ga.. Two days before his death, Montoya, a naturalized United States citizen employed by a Savannah-area tree service, had filed a formal complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Pablo Rangel-Rubio ran a scheme to employ illegal aliens at the tree service, profiting from the company while also skimming pay from the illegal workers. Four months earlier, Montoya also had reported the scheme to company officials.\n\n&gt;According to the indictment, authorities allege Pablo Rangel-Rubio paid Perez-Bravo to assist Juan Rangel-Rubio in killing Montoya in retaliation for reporting the conspiracy that is believed to have netted the brothers more than $3.5 million during the approximate 10-year period of the scheme.\n\n&gt;“Eliud Montoya was a naturalized citizen of the United States who worked hard and raised a family,” said U.S. Attorney Bobby L. Christine. “He went to the proper authorities to report a federal crime and for that he was murdered. Our office is committed to ensuring justice for Eliud Montoya, a man killed for doing the right thing, by those intent on protecting their illegal profits.”\n', ""Good lord, that's not how we do things guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get some english speaking friends to besmirch their reputation.

"", 'I\'m going to give you the other side of this issue.  I\'m not trying to change your mind - just something to think about. Full disclosure - I used to do corporate law a long time ago.\n\nThese cases are a lot like the ""cell phones cause brain cancer"" from the 90s.  These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.  You better believe there will be a ton of research done about this, and these are the types of questions that will be asked.  \n\nEDIT: because its coming up, the 11,700 defendants in the lawsuit are part of the \'talcum powder causes ovarian cancer\' lawsuit.  This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around.

We have a social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, and we also have an obligation to carry out our mission to serve youth, families and local communities through our programs. \n\nWe care deeply about all victims of child sex abuse and we are steadfast in our belief that one incident of child abuse is one too many. We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share. I wanted to update you today due to the news speculation, and I want to assure you that our daily mission will continue and that there are no imminent actions or immediate decisions expected. \n\nThank you for your continued support of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nMichael B.

I personally volunteer in a similar group for disadvantaged urban kids that's been able to produce a lot of awesome trips for them they'd never have gotten to go to otherwise.

I was extremely fortunate to grow up in the program myself and benefit from amazing examples of good men who never laid a finger on me and I'm so happy to pass along their gift of time and mentor-ship. \n\nBut the situation IS dangerous. You're talking about organizations that put kids in the middle of nowhere with adults. You HAVE to be extra cautious of who the leaders are and the best we can do is run background checks and set up rules like no leaders and kids sharing tents and requiring multiple leaders on any trips. \n\nBeyond that, be open to any concerns presented and be swift/immediate in action if any threat becomes known. If I was in the BSA leadership or the Catholic Church leadership for that matter I would basically set up a fund to specifically review these claims and do everything I could to harm and punish the offenders while protecting and restitution (as best as may be done) the victims. Responding with mere PR damage control isn't enough.

That's why they are filing for bankruptcy. \n\nI could care less if the scout master is gay, I care if he's a pedophile, but I don't care of he's gay. He shouldn't discuss his sexuality with the kids, but that has nothing to do with the fact that he is gay, straight men shouldn't discuss their sexuality with the kids either.\n\nGirls shouldn't be in boy scouts full stop. Gender segregated activities are super important for both sexes. Boys will not act the same with girls around as they do with all boys around and vise-versa.

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card.

Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working.

Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know.

Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility.

You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.

Clark Jr., 30, from Bloomingdale, has been charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine. According to court filings, the FBI received a tip-off from Clark’s family shortly after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. The family said that Jeffrey and his brother Edward — who committed suicide shortly after the Pittsburgh attack — were heavily involved in the so-called “alt-right” movement and knew the suspected Pittsburgh Synagogue shooter Robert Bowers through the far-right-friendly social media site Gab.\n\n&gt;Jeffrey Clark’s accounts on Gab give a true taste of the type of violent, neo-Nazi rhetoric he was spewing, as well as his potential capacity for violence. As HuffPost reported, on Gab Clark called himself “**DC Bowl Gang**,” a reference to the bowl-cut Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. As the court affidavit noted, the FBI’s investigation of Bowers had revealed that he was “friends” on Gab with Jeffrey Clark.\n\nThe mass killer also has friends in politics.\n\n&gt;Ever since Paul Nehlen(R)’s white supremacist beliefs were exposed last year, the Wisconsin also-ran has slid further and further into irrelevancy — and has become increasingly unhinged in the process.

If he had not gone directly to the EEOC I wonder if his murder would have been solved with as much understanding of the motives and context surrounding it. Have to wonder what, if anything, the company was doing about the situation once they were notified.\n\n&gt;The investigation began with the Aug. 19, 2017 death of Eliud Montoya, 41, who was found shot to death near his home in Garden City, Ga.. Two days before his death, Montoya, a naturalized United States citizen employed by a Savannah-area tree service, had filed a formal complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Pablo Rangel-Rubio ran a scheme to employ illegal aliens at the tree service, profiting from the company while also skimming pay from the illegal workers. Four months earlier, Montoya also had reported the scheme to company officials.\n\n&gt;According to the indictment, authorities allege Pablo Rangel-Rubio paid Perez-Bravo to assist Juan Rangel-Rubio in killing Montoya in retaliation for reporting the conspiracy that is believed to have netted the brothers more than $3.5 million during the approximate 10-year period of the scheme.\n\n&gt;“Eliud Montoya was a naturalized citizen of the United States who worked hard and raised a family,” said U.S. Attorney Bobby L. Christine. “He went to the proper authorities to report a federal crime and for that he was murdered.

Full disclosure - I used to do corporate law a long time ago.\n\nThese cases are a lot like the ""cell phones cause brain cancer"" from the 90s.  These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.  You better believe there will be a ton of research done about this, and these are the types of questions that will be asked.  \n\nEDIT: because its coming up, the 11,700 defendants in the lawsuit are part of the \'talcum powder causes ovarian cancer\' lawsuit.  This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around. But we cannot switch over immediately. We should all prefer that oil be moved the easiest and most efficient way. And no one should be ok with judges making decisions that they shouldn't make, in which they don't have the power or knowledge to make an actual decision."", ""I don't understand, regardless of there being a pipeline or not, oil is still gonna be processed and used.

We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share. I wanted to update you today due to the news speculation, and I want to assure you that our daily mission will continue and that there are no imminent actions or immediate decisions expected. \n\nThank you for your continued support of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nMichael B.

These gases are often odourless at higher more toxic concentrations. Some are heavier than air and someone walking through a ""pocket"" of gas in a hollow point can pass out before they even know the danger they are in.\n\nSome of these gases are created as a bi-product from mining; machines &amp; blasting, but many naturally seep out of coal seams after mining stops.\n\nAdd in disorientation due to the maze like production areas, unsafe ground conditions risking rock fall, risk of trapped water inrushes if an area is disturbed, or roof collapse, as well as mold/ fungi spores from growth in stagnant water, or old timbers and old mines are not safe places to venture into.\n\nStuff always gets left behind when a mine is closed down, especially when done quickly by creditors.\n\nFor a mine to start back up there are numerous steps taken to ensure worker safety.

If it doesn\'t work, well, it all seemed like a dream you know? I don\'t know why I was OK with it when it was happening.\n\nReality is scary as fuck.\n', 'Holy shit, I met a woman at the park (kids were playing) and she told me about going to see this guy.

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility. At least until someone comes up with a universal healthcare plan that doesn\'t look like it\'s going to bankrupt the nation. \n\n', 'What a mockery! Health insurance, doctors and medicine is already very high in US and people are afraid to get an ambulance and uber to hospital. US should look into other countries and understand and implement an all inclusive solution instead of this.', ""Let's put up a hypothetical and say that this goes all the way to SCOTUS and they perhaps uphold the decision. If that happens, what happens next? Does the Marketplace disappear entirely? What will happen to those covered currently? Can insurance companies then just drop anyone they want or remove coverage for things like pre-existing conditions? Will the Court give a deadline for which Congress will decide something new or else the Marketplace goes away? "", '2 things: for starters, we need up front pricing in healthcare facilities. This will create competition, and force the cost down. \n\nSecond, we need single payer, not this ""you\'re gonna by insurance under penalty of law"" crap. All it does is hurt the poor, and make insurance companies rich.', 'I keep seeing personal anecdotes about why the PPACA is good or why it was bad on this thread.  I’d like to argue that it should never have been passed in the first place—not because I believe forcing people to buy health insurance ~~under penalty of law~~ “or face higher taxes” is, on its face, unconstitutional; and not for any argument against socialized medicine; but because the intended aim of reducing the cost of healthcare isn’t addressed by the PPACA.\n\nHealth insurance is, at its core, a payment plan.  You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.  Whether that’s the government footing the bill itself or a single-payer healthcare system doesn’t really matter in my eyes, but you won’t see an end to corporate extortion of healthcare until the government gets a chance to do a public accounting of it all.', 'I had open heart surgery when I was 4, and 13 due to being born with a hole in my heart and having a defective valve.

Clark Jr., 30, from Bloomingdale, has been charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine. According to court filings, the FBI received a tip-off from Clark’s family shortly after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

Had a class with him freshman year and he rushed me for a few weeks, always got creepy vibes', 'According to the Prosecution, “Conflicting evidence and statements exist in this case making the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.’’\n\nIf a Prosecutor thinks a case can\'t be won, they typically won\'t waste their limited time and taxpayer money taking it to trial for nothing. Hence they went with a plea deal, which the judge accepted. \n\nShe [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/us/baylor-rape-allegation-letter-from-prosecutor/index.html) that ""it\'s my opinion it would be worse to try Anderson and lose and have the entire matter wiped from his criminal history than to accept this plea offer."" She recently tried a case that was very similar to this one, but even stronger, and still lost it, letting the accused off with a clean record and no legal punishment. \n\nThe article also states that the lack of DNA proof and conclusive physical evidence likely came into play, when the Prosecution went with this plea deal. \n\nThe public backlash is by people that are ill informed and just assuming this case would be easy to win if tried, and wouldn\'t be unprovable and therefore a waste of taxpayer dollars. \n\n-----\n\nEdit:\n\nSpecifically, in regards to the plea deal, Prosecutor also wrote that:\n\n&gt;""Part of his probation will be getting sex offender treatment and alcohol treatment. Without these terms, and if he\'s just found not guilty, there will be no reason to think his conduct will be different the next time he\'s in a bar and finds a woman who can\'t defend herself.""\n\n&gt;""Given the similarities, I\'m surprised the defense attorneys on Anderson are willing to plea him to anything and I don\'t want to squander the opportunity for there to be some consequence for him that might alter his behavior in the future.""\n\n', 'What about the prosecution who offered?

Where\'s the mention of DNA matching his found on the victim? Where are the witnesses?! The victim\'s statement implied he forcibly ""took \\[her\\] virginity"". Then there must be *some* evidence of that from a medical examination.\n\nIt\'s difficult to get at the truth, because whoever wrote that train wreck of journalism decided to intersperse what they know about the case with opinions and hypotheticals from attorneys who practice law up to 1,500 miles from where this crime took place. They\'re also trying to play on the emotions of simple-minded readers by devoting paragraphs to drawing parallels to Brock Turdner, which is b.s. because there were *witnesses* who saw Turdner raping his victim, so the outrage against Turdner was wholly justified.\n\nWhenever there\'s these cases, redditors through gritted teeth always pretend to care about letting the justice system play out, but instances like this prove if they don\'t like the verdict--despite the assertion from the *prosecutor herself* that there are multiple contradictions in the evidence and statements--they\'ll whine about a corrupt justice system and demand mob action.\n\nRemember your reaction to these cases before you condemn the lynch mobs of 100 years ago, kids.

Ugh. \n\nBut now it sounds like they had conflicting stories involving the rape, the DNA and other physical evidence did not corroborate what had been said, and I\'m hearing nothing about this ""well a jury in Waco..."".

There, the publicly available evidence was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim had in fact been raped.

If he had not gone directly to the EEOC I wonder if his murder would have been solved with as much understanding of the motives and context surrounding it. Have to wonder what, if anything, the company was doing about the situation once they were notified.\n\n&gt;The investigation began with the Aug. 19, 2017 death of Eliud Montoya, 41, who was found shot to death near his home in Garden City, Ga.. Two days before his death, Montoya, a naturalized United States citizen employed by a Savannah-area tree service, had filed a formal complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Pablo Rangel-Rubio ran a scheme to employ illegal aliens at the tree service, profiting from the company while also skimming pay from the illegal workers. Four months earlier, Montoya also had reported the scheme to company officials.\n\n&gt;According to the indictment, authorities allege Pablo Rangel-Rubio paid Perez-Bravo to assist Juan Rangel-Rubio in killing Montoya in retaliation for reporting the conspiracy that is believed to have netted the brothers more than $3.5 million during the approximate 10-year period of the scheme.\n\n&gt;“Eliud Montoya was a naturalized citizen of the United States who worked hard and raised a family,” said U.S. Attorney Bobby L.

These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.  You better believe there will be a ton of research done about this, and these are the types of questions that will be asked.  \n\nEDIT: because its coming up, the 11,700 defendants in the lawsuit are part of the \'talcum powder causes ovarian cancer\' lawsuit.  This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around.

We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share.

The news is so biased, they won't shed any light on it because they know the world will not support it. Israel needs to get rid of its fast right insane government as much as America needs to get rid of its far right religous zealot leaders. Western values are that all men are created equal with God given rights, yet Israel doesn't foster this belief instead choosing a theocratic faux democracy and apartheid. ""]",2

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

My wife solved the problem but quitting immediately. The manager calls her the next day and informs her she no showed and would be fired if she did it again.

Same with taking breaks MoD would say ""just let me know when you are gonna take your meal break (1 hour) and I\'ll get someone to cover for you"". Yeah that never fucking happened and I\'d get at least one call from some other manager (they were all dick heads too) bitching about how there\'s no carts. The final straw was when the only other store bitch quit so they needed me to cover his shifts, which was during school hours, I was in highschool at the time and made them well aware I could only work after school when they hired me.

When they gave everyone the raise we were told we would get bumped up to $11/hr *plus* a bonus based on how long we had been with the company. A few days before that bonus was supposed to show up in our paychecks we were told that the company had ""changed their mind"" and employees would have to decide if they wanted the raise or the bonus, but not both.\n\nHere\'s the kicker. Walmart claimed that the raise was part of the Trump tax cut, but they had been taking about the raise for months before the tax cuts. \n\nSo After Christmas, I decided to switch stores to be closer to where I was living. Walmart cut my pay to $10.00/hr for two weeks then bumped me up to $11. After that, employee hours dropped and I had to find a new job because yes, I was making $11/hr, but only getting 11 hours a week. That is standard operating procedure for Walmart. They both employ the working poor but they also peddle their worthless products to them to get their money back. \n\n', 'I worked for Walmart for 8 years.

I was called up to hr (eagerly thinking I got the job) but was informed I didn\'t get the job. Later that day the general manager spoke with me about the manager job and why I felt I should be fit for it. After a brief discussion he then informed me I would be training the manager they just hired/promoted. I was in shock, even stating ""your joking right?"" He told me I was the most knowledgeable about that department and I have the ability to run it ""smoothly"" That night I put in so many jobs applications.

Both say cutting out the mandate is not possible. \n\n4. Supreme Court says ""OK, fine. People in step 2 are right, a law **requiring** people to buy this insurance is unconstitutional. And we can\'t cut just that. So we\'re gonna rename it a tax - you\'re not **requiring** people to buy it, you\'re just taxing them if they don\'t."" \n\n5.

Republicans get in power and get rid of the penalty turned tax, because that sort of thing is against their principles/they love to eat babies, depending on whether you\'re honestly approaching your opponents views or are a redditor. \n\n7. But the mandate is still there. It\'s crucial to the bill, remember? But there\'s no penalty/fine/anything to allow people to call it a tax anymore. It\'s just a law requiring people to buy something.\n\n8. The Supreme Court already said you can\'t do that. That\'s why they renamed the penalty a tax.

This made pricier private facilities competitive by marketing themselves as providing better-quality healthcare. **After Boris Yeltsin was voted out of power, privatization was no longer the priority, with Vladimir Putin bringing back better funding to the state-owned healthcare system.**"" ', 'As a Canadian, my family has had a lot of issues.

The most i’ve had to wait was ~15 minutes, in a very large city. Looking back on it now, it’s a little funny that i was irritated about about having to pay $14 for day parking, after seeing all the horror stories of sky-high medical bills in the US. Why don’t the people of America want something better for themselves?', 'Serious question: do you think you’d be healthier if you weren’t presented a massive bill after treatment?

It feels patchy.\n\nIf anyone in the US wants some idea of how it should be, go into a veterinarian center. Basic checkup for my cat cost me $40, no insurance involved or even spoken of."", '“We don’t take kindly to folks who want affordable healthcare”\n\n-Texas', 'Whelp, looks like it\'s time for me to get downvoted again.\n\nLook..I have a kid with a long, complicated medical history that includes a life-threatening illness. I\'m fortunate in that my wife and I have good jobs. Not only do I have good family coverage benefits, but we can afford an additional private policy for my daughter. \n\nI am somewhat terrified of what would happen if we let that policy lapse.  Without the pre-existing condition clause of the ACA she most likely wouldn\'t be able to get health care insurance.  We\'d have my family coverage, but only until she\'s 26... another clause of the ACA.\n\nBut ... honestly ... and I say this as a diehard limited government fiscal conservative... universal healthcare would be better than the absolute mess of the ACA.\n\nThe Obama administration thought the ACA would be a good compromise.  The people wanted the pre-existing conditions clause and jobless, aimless millenials needed their parents health coverage until they were almost 30.\n\nThis was going to force the industry to take a pretty sizable financial hit and, believe it or not, the government actually doesn\'t want to regulate the profitability of an industry if they don\'t have to. Capitalism...go figure. \n\nSee, if you drive the profitability out of any industry, investors take their money elsewhere.  Reduce the number of players in the market and you\'ll reduce competition. Reduce competition and guaran-fucking-teed prices will rise, along with inefficiency and terrible services. \n\nSo the government *usually* avoids regulating the profitability out of an industry because it works out badly. \n\nSo, then, the government and the industry reach a compromise. Reduce the financial burden and mitigate the risks by requiring *everybody* - even the healthy people - to carry insurance. Or pay a financial penalty if they don\'t carry insurance. Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working. Subsidies!\n\nAnd where does the money come from to pay for subsidies?  The same place all government revenues come from: taxes!  Well, and bonds, tariffs and repaid debts, but *mostly taxes!*\n\nNow, lots Libertarian and Republican types - myself included - are pretty skeptical when the government forces us to do pretty much anything, so *of course* the individual mandate was challenged and went to the Supreme Court.  But lots of us knew how this was gonna go down. \n\nIt was a tax. It was always a tax. The Court saw that. It wasn\'t called a tax for political reasons, but what else could it possibly be?  It\'s a fee the government was forcing citizens to pay.  *It is a friggin\' tax.*\n\nNow, I can like taxes or not like taxes, but the fact is that Congress can make new taxes, so that\'s that. Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility. At least until someone comes up with a universal healthcare plan that doesn\'t look like it\'s going to bankrupt the nation. \n\n', 'What a mockery! Health insurance, doctors and medicine is already very high in US and people are afraid to get an ambulance and uber to hospital.

If that happens, what happens next? Does the Marketplace disappear entirely? What will happen to those covered currently? Can insurance companies then just drop anyone they want or remove coverage for things like pre-existing conditions? Will the Court give a deadline for which Congress will decide something new or else the Marketplace goes away? "", '2 things: for starters, we need up front pricing in healthcare facilities. This will create competition, and force the cost down. \n\nSecond, we need single payer, not this ""you\'re gonna by insurance under penalty of law"" crap. All it does is hurt the poor, and make insurance companies rich.', 'I keep seeing personal anecdotes about why the PPACA is good or why it was bad on this thread.  I’d like to argue that it should never have been passed in the first place—not because I believe forcing people to buy health insurance ~~under penalty of law~~ “or face higher taxes” is, on its face, unconstitutional; and not for any argument against socialized medicine; but because the intended aim of reducing the cost of healthcare isn’t addressed by the PPACA.\n\nHealth insurance is, at its core, a payment plan.  You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.  Whether that’s the government footing the bill itself or a single-payer healthcare system doesn’t really matter in my eyes, but you won’t see an end to corporate extortion of healthcare until the government gets a chance to do a public accounting of it all.', 'I had open heart surgery when I was 4, and 13 due to being born with a hole in my heart and having a defective valve.

Clark Jr., 30, from Bloomingdale, has been charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine. According to court filings, the FBI received a tip-off from Clark’s family shortly after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.

Hence they went with a plea deal, which the judge accepted. \n\nShe [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/us/baylor-rape-allegation-letter-from-prosecutor/index.html) that ""it\'s my opinion it would be worse to try Anderson and lose and have the entire matter wiped from his criminal history than to accept this plea offer."" She recently tried a case that was very similar to this one, but even stronger, and still lost it, letting the accused off with a clean record and no legal punishment. \n\nThe article also states that the lack of DNA proof and conclusive physical evidence likely came into play, when the Prosecution went with this plea deal. \n\nThe public backlash is by people that are ill informed and just assuming this case would be easy to win if tried, and wouldn\'t be unprovable and therefore a waste of taxpayer dollars. \n\n-----\n\nEdit:\n\nSpecifically, in regards to the plea deal, Prosecutor also wrote that:\n\n&gt;""Part of his probation will be getting sex offender treatment and alcohol treatment. Without these terms, and if he\'s just found not guilty, there will be no reason to think his conduct will be different the next time he\'s in a bar and finds a woman who can\'t defend herself.""\n\n&gt;""Given the similarities, I\'m surprised the defense attorneys on Anderson are willing to plea him to anything and I don\'t want to squander the opportunity for there to be some consequence for him that might alter his behavior in the future.""\n\n', 'What about the prosecution who offered?

Where\'s the mention of DNA matching his found on the victim? Where are the witnesses?! The victim\'s statement implied he forcibly ""took \\[her\\] virginity"". Then there must be *some* evidence of that from a medical examination.\n\nIt\'s difficult to get at the truth, because whoever wrote that train wreck of journalism decided to intersperse what they know about the case with opinions and hypotheticals from attorneys who practice law up to 1,500 miles from where this crime took place. They\'re also trying to play on the emotions of simple-minded readers by devoting paragraphs to drawing parallels to Brock Turdner, which is b.s. because there were *witnesses* who saw Turdner raping his victim, so the outrage against Turdner was wholly justified.\n\nWhenever there\'s these cases, redditors through gritted teeth always pretend to care about letting the justice system play out, but instances like this prove if they don\'t like the verdict--despite the assertion from the *prosecutor herself* that there are multiple contradictions in the evidence and statements--they\'ll whine about a corrupt justice system and demand mob action.\n\nRemember your reaction to these cases before you condemn the lynch mobs of 100 years ago, kids.

These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.

Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around. But we cannot switch over immediately. We should all prefer that oil be moved the easiest and most efficient way. And no one should be ok with judges making decisions that they shouldn't make, in which they don't have the power or knowledge to make an actual decision."", ""I don't understand, regardless of there being a pipeline or not, oil is still gonna be processed and used. How does a judge even quantify the impact of a pipeline on global climate change?"", ""This is so odd.  Does he think that without the pipeline the oil just won't be used?  They'll send it over road or rail and the effect on climate will be even worse. "", 'Yet in Michigan an Ignorant Governor allows Line 5 pipeline to continue under out Great Lakes.', 'Friendly reminder that the ""Keystone XL"" pipeline is actually phase 4 of a pipeline network.

You HAVE to be extra cautious of who the leaders are and the best we can do is run background checks and set up rules like no leaders and kids sharing tents and requiring multiple leaders on any trips. \n\nBeyond that, be open to any concerns presented and be swift/immediate in action if any threat becomes known. If I was in the BSA leadership or the Catholic Church leadership for that matter I would basically set up a fund to specifically review these claims and do everything I could to harm and punish the offenders while protecting and restitution (as best as may be done) the victims. Responding with mere PR damage control isn't enough. You need retributive justice against the bad elements and restorative justice towards the victims.\n\nIf you're a parent of kids in these programs, please be open to volunteering.

Just a temporary restructure of their system to make sure they can maximize their bill payments while minimizing the chance they get destroyed from all this.\n\nthis will likely mean as much as any of trumps bankruptcies.\n\n\n(the fact they had to do this do to widespread abuse, IS a bigger story, but just restructuring.. eh.. yawn)\n"", ""So much nonsense, the real reason is because the Mormon church pulled their funding (by far the largest contributor) because they allow gay scout masters.

That's why they are filing for bankruptcy. \n\nI could care less if the scout master is gay, I care if he's a pedophile, but I don't care of he's gay. He shouldn't discuss his sexuality with the kids, but that has nothing to do with the fact that he is gay, straight men shouldn't discuss their sexuality with the kids either.\n\nGirls shouldn't be in boy scouts full stop. Gender segregated activities are super important for both sexes. Boys will not act the same with girls around as they do with all boys around and vise-versa. They always had mixers between boy scouts and girl scouts, there are biological differences in behavior between men and women, it is not a social construct.\n\n""]",28

I was in a wheelchair and had an external fixator screwed into my leg (similar to what Ethan Hawke\'s character had in the first act of *Gattaca*). It was a very difficult time for my family and I: the doctors prescribed me Tylenol for the pain, so obviously I was in constant agony for weeks. At the time, my family and I were devout Catholics--we believed in miracles, apparitions, the whole nine.\n\nAnyway, my sister and I were attending a protest of this play called *Corprus Christi* with thousands of other Catholics. While we were there protesting, this Hispanic man in a suit appears out of nowhere from the crowd of protestors and walks right toward me. With him is another man carrying a huge video camera with a big bright light attached to it. I still remember how much the brightness of that light stunned me, because the protest was taking place at night. Honestly, the guy in the suit seemed nice and kind.\n\nHe crouches down until he\'s at my level, asking me my name, what was wrong with my leg, etc. So I told him about my surgery and he said ""God bless you, my son."" and he takes a small bottle of oil from his suit pocket, puts some on his finger, and rubs it on my afflicted leg in a ""cross"" shape. He does the same to my forehead then asks if he can pray for god to heal me. I said, barely concealing my desperation, ""Please do!""\n\nSo he places both hands on my afflicted leg and starts praying in Spanish at a mile a minute. The camera is still shining in my face, recording everything. All of a sudden, I start to feel a strange sensation throughout my body. At the time, I was convinced it was a miracle but now I realize there was probably some sort of chemical in the oil he anointed me with...if it even *was* oil. So he\'s chanting and praying and whatever the sensation I\'m feeling is, I\'m starting to have trouble breathing because of it.\n\nThen all of a sudden I hear a man\'s voice, in English say: ""*Excuse me*.""\n\nThe ""healer"" stops and stands up. Immediately I go back to normal. Was it anxiety? My mind playing tricks on me? At least it stopped. But at the time I was disappointed. The ""faith healer"" says: ""Yes?""\n\nA man in charge of the protest is standing beside him: ""We\'re not here for this sort of thing; please stop immediately.""\n\nThe ""faith healer"" agrees to stop. He shakes me hand, tells me god bless you, and offers me his card to try again another time. My sister takes his card. Then, he and the cameraman leave.\n\nIn hindsight, that protest organizer probably saved me from serious injury. I\'m almost positive that at the end of his ""prayer"", the ""healer"" would have commanded me to stand and walk. I would have done so, praising god for taking my burden away...and then I would have heard the crunch of my femur bone fracturing and maybe even seen it poking through the skin. lol.\n\nFortunately, we never got around to calling him, and my leg was healed through biology and physical therapy.\n\nDodged a bullet there, didn\'t I?\n\nHope I didn\'t bore too many of you with that story.', '300 women?

Walmart cut my pay to $10.00/hr for two weeks then bumped me up to $11. After that, employee hours dropped and I had to find a new job because yes, I was making $11/hr, but only getting 11 hours a week. That is standard operating procedure for Walmart.
