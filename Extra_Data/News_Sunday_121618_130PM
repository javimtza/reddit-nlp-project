During case, absolutely everyone agrees that the bill cannot stand without mandate. Democrats say ""so leave it alone"", Republicans say ""so kill it"". Both say cutting out the mandate is not possible. \n\n4. Supreme Court says ""OK, fine. People in step 2 are right, a law **requiring** people to buy this insurance is unconstitutional. And we can\'t cut just that. So we\'re gonna rename it a tax - you\'re not **requiring** people to buy it, you\'re just taxing them if they don\'t."" \n\n5. Lots of people cheer and say, yeah, that\'s right, we meant to call it a tax all along, thank you Supreme Court. Lots of other people boo and say that\'s no good either. \n\n6. Republicans get in power and get rid of the penalty turned tax, because that sort of thing is against their principles/they love to eat babies, depending on whether you\'re honestly approaching your opponents views or are a redditor. \n\n7. But the mandate is still there. It\'s crucial to the bill, remember? But there\'s no penalty/fine/anything to allow people to call it a tax anymore. It\'s just a law requiring people to buy something.\n\n8. The Supreme Court already said you can\'t do that. That\'s why they renamed the penalty a tax. But you can\'t call it a tax anymore, because there\'s no money associated with it any more.\n\n9. People sue. Again. \n\n9.

So this judge says ""According to what the Supreme Court said last time, the bill can\'t stand without the ~~mandate~~tax, and the newly modified law made it impossible to call it a tax instead of mandate, so it\'s unconstitutional, so the whole bill falls.""\n\nIs that it? \n\nIf so, we\'ll see if another ""well actually, it\'s a ______"" argument turns up.

Car insurance laws are state laws, not federal, so have different legal limitations. \n\n2. Car insurance is conditionally mandated.

Healthcare as a private industry and having to insure people with pre-existing conditions does not make sense. (Imagine you bought car insurance or home insurance after your car get in an accident or your home was destroyed by a tornado or hurricane). For a private industry it does not make sense.

Reduce competition and guaran-fucking-teed prices will rise, along with inefficiency and terrible services. \n\nSo the government *usually* avoids regulating the profitability out of an industry because it works out badly. \n\nSo, then, the government and the industry reach a compromise. Reduce the financial burden and mitigate the risks by requiring *everybody* - even the healthy people - to carry insurance. Or pay a financial penalty if they don\'t carry insurance. Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working.

It\'s a fee the government was forcing citizens to pay.  *It is a friggin\' tax.*\n\nNow, I can like taxes or not like taxes, but the fact is that Congress can make new taxes, so that\'s that. Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility. At least until someone comes up with a universal healthcare plan that doesn\'t look like it\'s going to bankrupt the nation. \n\n', 'I keep seeing personal anecdotes about why the PPACA is good or why it was bad on this thread.  I’d like to argue that it should never have been passed in the first place—not because I believe forcing people to buy health insurance ~~under penalty of law~~ “or face higher taxes” is, on its face, unconstitutional; and not for any argument against socialized medicine; but because the intended aim of reducing the cost of healthcare isn’t addressed by the PPACA.\n\nHealth insurance is, at its core, a payment plan.  You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.  Whether that’s the government footing the bill itself or a single-payer healthcare system doesn’t really matter in my eyes, but you won’t see an end to corporate extortion of healthcare until the government gets a chance to do a public accounting of it all.', 'I had open heart surgery when I was 4, and 13 due to being born with a hole in my heart and having a defective valve.

Clark Jr., 30, from Bloomingdale, has been charged with illegally possessing a firearm and a high-capacity magazine. According to court filings, the FBI received a tip-off from Clark’s family shortly after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. The family said that Jeffrey and his brother Edward — who committed suicide shortly after the Pittsburgh attack — were heavily involved in the so-called “alt-right” movement and knew the suspected Pittsburgh Synagogue shooter Robert Bowers through the far-right-friendly social media site Gab.\n\n&gt;Jeffrey Clark’s accounts on Gab give a true taste of the type of violent, neo-Nazi rhetoric he was spewing, as well as his potential capacity for violence. As HuffPost reported, on Gab Clark called himself “**DC Bowl Gang**,” a reference to the bowl-cut Dylann Roof, who murdered nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. As the court affidavit noted, the FBI’s investigation of Bowers had revealed that he was “friends” on Gab with Jeffrey Clark.\n\nThe mass killer also has friends in politics.\n\n&gt;Ever since Paul Nehlen(R)’s white supremacist beliefs were exposed last year, the Wisconsin also-ran has slid further and further into irrelevancy — and has become increasingly unhinged in the process.

Hence they went with a plea deal, which the judge accepted. \n\nShe [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/us/baylor-rape-allegation-letter-from-prosecutor/index.html) that ""it\'s my opinion it would be worse to try Anderson and lose and have the entire matter wiped from his criminal history than to accept this plea offer."" She recently tried a case that was very similar to this one, but even stronger, and still lost it, letting the accused off with a clean record and no legal punishment. \n\nThe article also states that the lack of DNA proof and conclusive physical evidence likely came into play, when the Prosecution went with this plea deal. \n\nThe public backlash is by people that are ill informed and just assuming this case would be easy to win if tried, and wouldn\'t be unprovable and therefore a waste of taxpayer dollars. \n\n-----\n\nEdit:\n\nSpecifically, in regards to the plea deal, Prosecutor also wrote that:\n\n&gt;""Part of his probation will be getting sex offender treatment and alcohol treatment. Without these terms, and if he\'s just found not guilty, there will be no reason to think his conduct will be different the next time he\'s in a bar and finds a woman who can\'t defend herself.""\n\n&gt;""Given the similarities, I\'m surprised the defense attorneys on Anderson are willing to plea him to anything and I don\'t want to squander the opportunity for there to be some consequence for him that might alter his behavior in the future.""\n\n', 'What about the prosecution who offered?

Where\'s the mention of DNA matching his found on the victim? Where are the witnesses?! The victim\'s statement implied he forcibly ""took \\[her\\] virginity"". Then there must be *some* evidence of that from a medical examination.\n\nIt\'s difficult to get at the truth, because whoever wrote that train wreck of journalism decided to intersperse what they know about the case with opinions and hypotheticals from attorneys who practice law up to 1,500 miles from where this crime took place. They\'re also trying to play on the emotions of simple-minded readers by devoting paragraphs to drawing parallels to Brock Turdner, which is b.s. because there were *witnesses* who saw Turdner raping his victim, so the outrage against Turdner was wholly justified.\n\nWhenever there\'s these cases, redditors through gritted teeth always pretend to care about letting the justice system play out, but instances like this prove if they don\'t like the verdict--despite the assertion from the *prosecutor herself* that there are multiple contradictions in the evidence and statements--they\'ll whine about a corrupt justice system and demand mob action.\n\nRemember your reaction to these cases before you condemn the lynch mobs of 100 years ago, kids.

These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.

This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around. But we cannot switch over immediately. We should all prefer that oil be moved the easiest and most efficient way. And no one should be ok with judges making decisions that they shouldn't make, in which they don't have the power or knowledge to make an actual decision."", ""I don't understand, regardless of there being a pipeline or not, oil is still gonna be processed and used.

We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share.

Israel is currently attacking Lebanon and anyone who shows signs of resisting the Poland like land grab Israel is doing. Many Palestinians have united and will fight to protect their land so Israel is arresting and silencing them so the world can't see or hear their struggle. Iran and hezbollah said they will attack if Israel makes this move. Macron and Trump are leading us to a war with Iran so Israel can take over palestine. The news is so biased, they won't shed any light on it because they know the world will not support it. Israel needs to get rid of its fast right insane government as much as America needs to get rid of its far right religous zealot leaders. Western values are that all men are created equal with God given rights, yet Israel doesn't foster this belief instead choosing a theocratic faux democracy and apartheid. ""]",2

He brought this up with Sinise over one of the dinners and the two of them had a brief but beautiful conversation about the change in American’s sense of self possession as a united country since the end of the Second World War. I found Sinise to be open minded, thoughtful, kind and giving. He articulated a political position that was undeniably conservative, but a type of conservatism that wasn’t about hating the poor or the less powerful and he flatly rejected Trumpian division as un-American. \n\nHe may just be a goofy actor with a lot of money and a weird hobby, but he absolutely gave my grandfather and me a gift that I will be thankful for for the rest of my life.

During case, absolutely everyone agrees that the bill cannot stand without mandate. Democrats say ""so leave it alone"", Republicans say ""so kill it"". Both say cutting out the mandate is not possible. \n\n4. Supreme Court says ""OK, fine. People in step 2 are right, a law **requiring** people to buy this insurance is unconstitutional. And we can\'t cut just that. So we\'re gonna rename it a tax - you\'re not **requiring** people to buy it, you\'re just taxing them if they don\'t."" \n\n5. Lots of people cheer and say, yeah, that\'s right, we meant to call it a tax all along, thank you Supreme Court. Lots of other people boo and say that\'s no good either. \n\n6. Republicans get in power and get rid of the penalty turned tax, because that sort of thing is against their principles/they love to eat babies, depending on whether you\'re honestly approaching your opponents views or are a redditor. \n\n7. But the mandate is still there. It\'s crucial to the bill, remember? But there\'s no penalty/fine/anything to allow people to call it a tax anymore. It\'s just a law requiring people to buy something.\n\n8. The Supreme Court already said you can\'t do that. That\'s why they renamed the penalty a tax. But you can\'t call it a tax anymore, because there\'s no money associated with it any more.\n\n9. People sue. Again. \n\n9.

So this judge says ""According to what the Supreme Court said last time, the bill can\'t stand without the ~~mandate~~tax, and the newly modified law made it impossible to call it a tax instead of mandate, so it\'s unconstitutional, so the whole bill falls.""\n\nIs that it? \n\nIf so, we\'ll see if another ""well actually, it\'s a ______"" argument turns up.

Everyone pays a different price for the same service (depending on your insurance company).\n2.

No competition in my opinion results in being scammed to pay very high price for everything.\n4. The uninsured that go to the ER get subsidized by the people who have insurance (AKA the people with insurance end up getting charged more to compensate the loss the hospital incurs from them required to help people who walk in to the ER without insurance).\n5. Healthcare as a private industry and having to insure people with pre-existing conditions does not make sense. (Imagine you bought car insurance or home insurance after your car get in an accident or your home was destroyed by a tornado or hurricane). For a private industry it does not make sense. If we are going to insure people with pre existing conditions it would seem only logical to have a federal government run healthcare system and not private.\n\nI think the ACA could of been better.

It is Congress' job to determine what laws it thinks are workable and the court's to consider unforeseen circumstances and clarify details as needed, throwing out laws or elements of laws only they are patently illegal, as the ACA with the penalty was already established to not be.

I\'m fortunate in that my wife and I have good jobs. Not only do I have good family coverage benefits, but we can afford an additional private policy for my daughter. \n\nI am somewhat terrified of what would happen if we let that policy lapse.  Without the pre-existing condition clause of the ACA she most likely wouldn\'t be able to get health care insurance.  We\'d have my family coverage, but only until she\'s 26... another clause of the ACA.\n\nBut ... honestly ... and I say this as a diehard limited government fiscal conservative... universal healthcare would be better than the absolute mess of the ACA.\n\nThe Obama administration thought the ACA would be a good compromise.  The people wanted the pre-existing conditions clause and jobless, aimless millenials needed their parents health coverage until they were almost 30.\n\nThis was going to force the industry to take a pretty sizable financial hit and, believe it or not, the government actually doesn\'t want to regulate the profitability of an industry if they don\'t have to. Capitalism...go figure. \n\nSee, if you drive the profitability out of any industry, investors take their money elsewhere.  Reduce the number of players in the market and you\'ll reduce competition. Reduce competition and guaran-fucking-teed prices will rise, along with inefficiency and terrible services. \n\nSo the government *usually* avoids regulating the profitability out of an industry because it works out badly. \n\nSo, then, the government and the industry reach a compromise. Reduce the financial burden and mitigate the risks by requiring *everybody* - even the healthy people - to carry insurance. Or pay a financial penalty if they don\'t carry insurance. Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working. Subsidies!\n\nAnd where does the money come from to pay for subsidies?  The same place all government revenues come from: taxes!  Well, and bonds, tariffs and repaid debts, but *mostly taxes!*\n\nNow, lots Libertarian and Republican types - myself included - are pretty skeptical when the government forces us to do pretty much anything, so *of course* the individual mandate was challenged and went to the Supreme Court.  But lots of us knew how this was gonna go down. \n\nIt was a tax. It was always a tax. The Court saw that. It wasn\'t called a tax for political reasons, but what else could it possibly be?  It\'s a fee the government was forcing citizens to pay.  *It is a friggin\' tax.*\n\nNow, I can like taxes or not like taxes, but the fact is that Congress can make new taxes, so that\'s that. Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility. At least until someone comes up with a universal healthcare plan that doesn\'t look like it\'s going to bankrupt the nation. \n\n', 'I keep seeing personal anecdotes about why the PPACA is good or why it was bad on this thread.  I’d like to argue that it should never have been passed in the first place—not because I believe forcing people to buy health insurance ~~under penalty of law~~ “or face higher taxes” is, on its face, unconstitutional; and not for any argument against socialized medicine; but because the intended aim of reducing the cost of healthcare isn’t addressed by the PPACA.\n\nHealth insurance is, at its core, a payment plan.  You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.

Had a class with him freshman year and he rushed me for a few weeks, always got creepy vibes', 'According to the Prosecution, “Conflicting evidence and statements exist in this case making the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.’’\n\nIf a Prosecutor thinks a case can\'t be won, they typically won\'t waste their limited time and taxpayer money taking it to trial for nothing. Hence they went with a plea deal, which the judge accepted. \n\nShe [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/us/baylor-rape-allegation-letter-from-prosecutor/index.html) that ""it\'s my opinion it would be worse to try Anderson and lose and have the entire matter wiped from his criminal history than to accept this plea offer."" She recently tried a case that was very similar to this one, but even stronger, and still lost it, letting the accused off with a clean record and no legal punishment. \n\nThe article also states that the lack of DNA proof and conclusive physical evidence likely came into play, when the Prosecution went with this plea deal. \n\nThe public backlash is by people that are ill informed and just assuming this case would be easy to win if tried, and wouldn\'t be unprovable and therefore a waste of taxpayer dollars. \n\n-----\n\nEdit:\n\nSpecifically, in regards to the plea deal, Prosecutor also wrote that:\n\n&gt;""Part of his probation will be getting sex offender treatment and alcohol treatment. Without these terms, and if he\'s just found not guilty, there will be no reason to think his conduct will be different the next time he\'s in a bar and finds a woman who can\'t defend herself.""\n\n&gt;""Given the similarities, I\'m surprised the defense attorneys on Anderson are willing to plea him to anything and I don\'t want to squander the opportunity for there to be some consequence for him that might alter his behavior in the future.""\n\n', 'What about the prosecution who offered?

Where\'s the mention of DNA matching his found on the victim? Where are the witnesses?! The victim\'s statement implied he forcibly ""took \\[her\\] virginity"". Then there must be *some* evidence of that from a medical examination.\n\nIt\'s difficult to get at the truth, because whoever wrote that train wreck of journalism decided to intersperse what they know about the case with opinions and hypotheticals from attorneys who practice law up to 1,500 miles from where this crime took place. They\'re also trying to play on the emotions of simple-minded readers by devoting paragraphs to drawing parallels to Brock Turdner, which is b.s. because there were *witnesses* who saw Turdner raping his victim, so the outrage against Turdner was wholly justified.\n\nWhenever there\'s these cases, redditors through gritted teeth always pretend to care about letting the justice system play out, but instances like this prove if they don\'t like the verdict--despite the assertion from the *prosecutor herself* that there are multiple contradictions in the evidence and statements--they\'ll whine about a corrupt justice system and demand mob action.\n\nRemember your reaction to these cases before you condemn the lynch mobs of 100 years ago, kids.

Apologies if my hostile tone confused some of you.', 'At the onset of the plea deal, the prosecutor was quoted (perhaps incorrectly) that they ""didn\'t think a Waco jury would be likely to convict a young person on their first count of rape"". Another way of putting it is they won\'t ruin a young white males chances of success all because of ""one foolish act"". Ugh. \n\nBut now it sounds like they had conflicting stories involving the rape, the DNA and other physical evidence did not corroborate what had been said, and I\'m hearing nothing about this ""well a jury in Waco..."".

The show would be a lot less interesting if every rapist just got a plea bargain.\n\nHow can we objectively find a solution that results in more criminals going to jail without resulting in innocents being caught in the crossfire?

There, the judge did not go with the prosecutor’s recommendation. There, the publicly available evidence was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim had in fact been raped. The Turner case is very different from this one where we have no idea what evidence the court was presented with. \n\nOur society has had a tendency of discounting sexual crimes in the past. We must be aware of this bias, but we cannot assume that every prosecutor who declines to prosecute or recommends a light penalty is acting on that bias.

Have to wonder what, if anything, the company was doing about the situation once they were notified.\n\n&gt;The investigation began with the Aug. 19, 2017 death of Eliud Montoya, 41, who was found shot to death near his home in Garden City, Ga.. Two days before his death, Montoya, a naturalized United States citizen employed by a Savannah-area tree service, had filed a formal complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Pablo Rangel-Rubio ran a scheme to employ illegal aliens at the tree service, profiting from the company while also skimming pay from the illegal workers. Four months earlier, Montoya also had reported the scheme to company officials.\n\n&gt;According to the indictment, authorities allege Pablo Rangel-Rubio paid Perez-Bravo to assist Juan Rangel-Rubio in killing Montoya in retaliation for reporting the conspiracy that is believed to have netted the brothers more than $3.5 million during the approximate 10-year period of the scheme.\n\n&gt;“Eliud Montoya was a naturalized citizen of the United States who worked hard and raised a family,” said U.S. Attorney Bobby L.

Full disclosure - I used to do corporate law a long time ago.\n\nThese cases are a lot like the ""cell phones cause brain cancer"" from the 90s.  These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.  You better believe there will be a ton of research done about this, and these are the types of questions that will be asked.  \n\nEDIT: because its coming up, the 11,700 defendants in the lawsuit are part of the \'talcum powder causes ovarian cancer\' lawsuit.  This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around. But we cannot switch over immediately. We should all prefer that oil be moved the easiest and most efficient way. And no one should be ok with judges making decisions that they shouldn't make, in which they don't have the power or knowledge to make an actual decision."", ""I don't understand, regardless of there being a pipeline or not, oil is still gonna be processed and used.

We have a social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, and we also have an obligation to carry out our mission to serve youth, families and local communities through our programs. \n\nWe care deeply about all victims of child sex abuse and we are steadfast in our belief that one incident of child abuse is one too many. We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share. I wanted to update you today due to the news speculation, and I want to assure you that our daily mission will continue and that there are no imminent actions or immediate decisions expected. \n\nThank you for your continued support of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nMichael B.

You're talking about organizations that put kids in the middle of nowhere with adults. You HAVE to be extra cautious of who the leaders are and the best we can do is run background checks and set up rules like no leaders and kids sharing tents and requiring multiple leaders on any trips. \n\nBeyond that, be open to any concerns presented and be swift/immediate in action if any threat becomes known. If I was in the BSA leadership or the Catholic Church leadership for that matter I would basically set up a fund to specifically review these claims and do everything I could to harm and punish the offenders while protecting and restitution (as best as may be done) the victims.

After that, employee hours dropped and I had to find a new job because yes, I was making $11/hr, but only getting 11 hours a week. That is standard operating procedure for Walmart.

During case, absolutely everyone agrees that the bill cannot stand without mandate. Democrats say ""so leave it alone"", Republicans say ""so kill it"". Both say cutting out the mandate is not possible. \n\n4. Supreme Court says ""OK, fine. People in step 2 are right, a law **requiring** people to buy this insurance is unconstitutional. And we can\'t cut just that. So we\'re gonna rename it a tax - you\'re not **requiring** people to buy it, you\'re just taxing them if they don\'t."" \n\n5. Lots of people cheer and say, yeah, that\'s right, we meant to call it a tax all along, thank you Supreme Court. Lots of other people boo and say that\'s no good either. \n\n6. Republicans get in power and get rid of the penalty turned tax, because that sort of thing is against their principles/they love to eat babies, depending on whether you\'re honestly approaching your opponents views or are a redditor. \n\n7. But the mandate is still there. It\'s crucial to the bill, remember? But there\'s no penalty/fine/anything to allow people to call it a tax anymore. It\'s just a law requiring people to buy something.\n\n8. The Supreme Court already said you can\'t do that. That\'s why they renamed the penalty a tax. But you can\'t call it a tax anymore, because there\'s no money associated with it any more.\n\n9. People sue. Again. \n\n9. This judge looks at this stuff and says ""well, the Supreme Court already said the bill can\'t stand without the mandate in some form, and they also said the mandate can\'t be a literal mandate, but has to be a tax instead.

I became largely self employed in June and enrolled in my husband’s insurance. We figured we were all set after we signed paperwork with his HR department and received our cards in the mail. It turns out a third party company needed documents verifying that we are actually married and live together, and in the midst of a move my husband somehow missed the letters. My insurance was cancelled and we’re in the midst of an appeal. \n\nAnyway...I decided to apply for a plan in the marketplace to cover my ass just in case we lose the appeal. The cheapest plan available to me (self employed full time student beginning in January) is $300 a month with an $8000 deductible. My husband doesn’t make a ton of money, either. With an $8,000 deductible and $300 a month I’m better off signing up for a local hospital’s plan for uninsured patients and waiting for my husband’s open enrollment period to roll around again.

Everyone pays a different price for the same service (depending on your insurance company).\n2.

No competition in my opinion results in being scammed to pay very high price for everything.\n4. The uninsured that go to the ER get subsidized by the people who have insurance (AKA the people with insurance end up getting charged more to compensate the loss the hospital incurs from them required to help people who walk in to the ER without insurance).\n5. Healthcare as a private industry and having to insure people with pre-existing conditions does not make sense. (Imagine you bought car insurance or home insurance after your car get in an accident or your home was destroyed by a tornado or hurricane). For a private industry it does not make sense. If we are going to insure people with pre existing conditions it would seem only logical to have a federal government run healthcare system and not private.\n\nI think the ACA could of been better.

I\'m fortunate in that my wife and I have good jobs. Not only do I have good family coverage benefits, but we can afford an additional private policy for my daughter. \n\nI am somewhat terrified of what would happen if we let that policy lapse.  Without the pre-existing condition clause of the ACA she most likely wouldn\'t be able to get health care insurance.  We\'d have my family coverage, but only until she\'s 26... another clause of the ACA.\n\nBut ... honestly ... and I say this as a diehard limited government fiscal conservative... universal healthcare would be better than the absolute mess of the ACA.\n\nThe Obama administration thought the ACA would be a good compromise.  The people wanted the pre-existing conditions clause and jobless, aimless millenials needed their parents health coverage until they were almost 30.\n\nThis was going to force the industry to take a pretty sizable financial hit and, believe it or not, the government actually doesn\'t want to regulate the profitability of an industry if they don\'t have to. Capitalism...go figure. \n\nSee, if you drive the profitability out of any industry, investors take their money elsewhere.  Reduce the number of players in the market and you\'ll reduce competition. Reduce competition and guaran-fucking-teed prices will rise, along with inefficiency and terrible services. \n\nSo the government *usually* avoids regulating the profitability out of an industry because it works out badly. \n\nSo, then, the government and the industry reach a compromise. Reduce the financial burden and mitigate the risks by requiring *everybody* - even the healthy people - to carry insurance. Or pay a financial penalty if they don\'t carry insurance. Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working. Subsidies!\n\nAnd where does the money come from to pay for subsidies?  The same place all government revenues come from: taxes!  Well, and bonds, tariffs and repaid debts, but *mostly taxes!*\n\nNow, lots Libertarian and Republican types - myself included - are pretty skeptical when the government forces us to do pretty much anything, so *of course* the individual mandate was challenged and went to the Supreme Court.  But lots of us knew how this was gonna go down. \n\nIt was a tax. It was always a tax. The Court saw that. It wasn\'t called a tax for political reasons, but what else could it possibly be?  It\'s a fee the government was forcing citizens to pay.  *It is a friggin\' tax.*\n\nNow, I can like taxes or not like taxes, but the fact is that Congress can make new taxes, so that\'s that. Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility. At least until someone comes up with a universal healthcare plan that doesn\'t look like it\'s going to bankrupt the nation. \n\n', 'I keep seeing personal anecdotes about why the PPACA is good or why it was bad on this thread.  I’d like to argue that it should never have been passed in the first place—not because I believe forcing people to buy health insurance ~~under penalty of law~~ “or face higher taxes” is, on its face, unconstitutional; and not for any argument against socialized medicine; but because the intended aim of reducing the cost of healthcare isn’t addressed by the PPACA.\n\nHealth insurance is, at its core, a payment plan.  You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.

557,Texas judge who approved plea deal for alleged Baylor University rapist faces public backlash,news,7301,a654l5/texas_judge_who_approved_plea_deal_for_alleged/,"['Wow, pretty crazy to see this guy on the front page of Reddit. Had a class with him freshman year and he rushed me for a few weeks, always got creepy vibes', 'According to the Prosecution, “Conflicting evidence and statements exist in this case making the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.’’\n\nIf a Prosecutor thinks a case can\'t be won, they typically won\'t waste their limited time and taxpayer money taking it to trial for nothing. Hence they went with a plea deal, which the judge accepted. \n\nShe [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/us/baylor-rape-allegation-letter-from-prosecutor/index.html) that ""it\'s my opinion it would be worse to try Anderson and lose and have the entire matter wiped from his criminal history than to accept this plea offer."" She recently tried a case that was very similar to this one, but even stronger, and still lost it, letting the accused off with a clean record and no legal punishment. \n\nThe article also states that the lack of DNA proof and conclusive physical evidence likely came into play, when the Prosecution went with this plea deal. \n\nThe public backlash is by people that are ill informed and just assuming this case would be easy to win if tried, and wouldn\'t be unprovable and therefore a waste of taxpayer dollars. \n\n-----\n\nEdit:\n\nSpecifically, in regards to the plea deal, Prosecutor also wrote that:\n\n&gt;""Part of his probation will be getting sex offender treatment and alcohol treatment. Without these terms, and if he\'s just found not guilty, there will be no reason to think his conduct will be different the next time he\'s in a bar and finds a woman who can\'t defend herself.""\n\n&gt;""Given the similarities, I\'m surprised the defense attorneys on Anderson are willing to plea him to anything and I don\'t want to squander the opportunity for there to be some consequence for him that might alter his behavior in the future.""\n\n', 'What about the prosecution who offered?

Where\'s the mention of DNA matching his found on the victim? Where are the witnesses?! The victim\'s statement implied he forcibly ""took \\[her\\] virginity"". Then there must be *some* evidence of that from a medical examination.\n\nIt\'s difficult to get at the truth, because whoever wrote that train wreck of journalism decided to intersperse what they know about the case with opinions and hypotheticals from attorneys who practice law up to 1,500 miles from where this crime took place. They\'re also trying to play on the emotions of simple-minded readers by devoting paragraphs to drawing parallels to Brock Turdner, which is b.s. because there were *witnesses* who saw Turdner raping his victim, so the outrage against Turdner was wholly justified.\n\nWhenever there\'s these cases, redditors through gritted teeth always pretend to care about letting the justice system play out, but instances like this prove if they don\'t like the verdict--despite the assertion from the *prosecutor herself* that there are multiple contradictions in the evidence and statements--they\'ll whine about a corrupt justice system and demand mob action.\n\nRemember your reaction to these cases before you condemn the lynch mobs of 100 years ago, kids.

Ugh. \n\nBut now it sounds like they had conflicting stories involving the rape, the DNA and other physical evidence did not corroborate what had been said, and I\'m hearing nothing about this ""well a jury in Waco..."".

There, the publicly available evidence was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim had in fact been raped.

"", 'I\'m going to give you the other side of this issue.  I\'m not trying to change your mind - just something to think about. Full disclosure - I used to do corporate law a long time ago.\n\nThese cases are a lot like the ""cell phones cause brain cancer"" from the 90s.  These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.  You better believe there will be a ton of research done about this, and these are the types of questions that will be asked.  \n\nEDIT: because its coming up, the 11,700 defendants in the lawsuit are part of the \'talcum powder causes ovarian cancer\' lawsuit.  This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

[An environmental assessment had already been conducted under Obama.](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/keystone-xl-pipeline-environmental-impact-statement/789/) This judge has no reason to say that a new assessment has to be conducted. Their is no law/rule that says Trump had to do another assessment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Furthermore, pipelines are the best and safest way to transport oil.](https://www.strata.org/pdf/2017/pipelines.pdf)\n\n&gt;Transporting oil and gas by pipeline is generally cheaper than transporting it by rail or truck. **On average, it costs about $5 per barrel to transport oil and gas by pipeline compared to $10-$15 a barrel for rail and $20 a barrel by truck.11**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, when compared with both train and truck transportation, pipeline is actually the safest method of transporting oil and gas. **Oil and gas transportation by pipeline resulted in 1.7 fatalities to operators, personnel, and the general public per year in the United States. Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around. But we cannot switch over immediately. We should all prefer that oil be moved the easiest and most efficient way. And no one should be ok with judges making decisions that they shouldn't make, in which they don't have the power or knowledge to make an actual decision."", ""I don't understand, regardless of there being a pipeline or not, oil is still gonna be processed and used.

We have an important duty, and an incredible opportunity, to focus as an organization on keeping children safe, supported and protected, and preparing youth for their futures through our nation’s foremost program of character development and values-based leadership training. \n\nTo do so in perpetuity, we are working with experts to explore all options available to ensure that the local and national programming of the Boy Scout of America continues uninterrupted. We have a social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, and we also have an obligation to carry out our mission to serve youth, families and local communities through our programs. \n\nWe care deeply about all victims of child sex abuse and we are steadfast in our belief that one incident of child abuse is one too many. We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share. I wanted to update you today due to the news speculation, and I want to assure you that our daily mission will continue and that there are no imminent actions or immediate decisions expected. \n\nThank you for your continued support of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nMichael B.

I was extremely fortunate to grow up in the program myself and benefit from amazing examples of good men who never laid a finger on me and I'm so happy to pass along their gift of time and mentor-ship. \n\nBut the situation IS dangerous. You're talking about organizations that put kids in the middle of nowhere with adults. You HAVE to be extra cautious of who the leaders are and the best we can do is run background checks and set up rules like no leaders and kids sharing tents and requiring multiple leaders on any trips. \n\nBeyond that, be open to any concerns presented and be swift/immediate in action if any threat becomes known. If I was in the BSA leadership or the Catholic Church leadership for that matter I would basically set up a fund to specifically review these claims and do everything I could to harm and punish the offenders while protecting and restitution (as best as may be done) the victims. Responding with mere PR damage control isn't enough.

After that, employee hours dropped and I had to find a new job because yes, I was making $11/hr, but only getting 11 hours a week. That is standard operating procedure for Walmart.

During case, absolutely everyone agrees that the bill cannot stand without mandate. Democrats say ""so leave it alone"", Republicans say ""so kill it"". Both say cutting out the mandate is not possible. \n\n4. Supreme Court says ""OK, fine. People in step 2 are right, a law **requiring** people to buy this insurance is unconstitutional. And we can\'t cut just that. So we\'re gonna rename it a tax - you\'re not **requiring** people to buy it, you\'re just taxing them if they don\'t."" \n\n5. Lots of people cheer and say, yeah, that\'s right, we meant to call it a tax all along, thank you Supreme Court. Lots of other people boo and say that\'s no good either. \n\n6. Republicans get in power and get rid of the penalty turned tax, because that sort of thing is against their principles/they love to eat babies, depending on whether you\'re honestly approaching your opponents views or are a redditor. \n\n7. But the mandate is still there. It\'s crucial to the bill, remember? But there\'s no penalty/fine/anything to allow people to call it a tax anymore. It\'s just a law requiring people to buy something.\n\n8. The Supreme Court already said you can\'t do that. That\'s why they renamed the penalty a tax. But you can\'t call it a tax anymore, because there\'s no money associated with it any more.\n\n9. People sue. Again. \n\n9. This judge looks at this stuff and says ""well, the Supreme Court already said the bill can\'t stand without the mandate in some form, and they also said the mandate can\'t be a literal mandate, but has to be a tax instead. But it\'s definitely not a tax any more, and it\'s back to being a mandate, if a toothless one.\n\n10. So this judge says ""According to what the Supreme Court said last time, the bill can\'t stand without the ~~mandate~~tax, and the newly modified law made it impossible to call it a tax instead of mandate, so it\'s unconstitutional, so the whole bill falls.""\n\nIs that it? \n\nIf so, we\'ll see if another ""well actually, it\'s a ______"" argument turns up.

I became largely self employed in June and enrolled in my husband’s insurance. We figured we were all set after we signed paperwork with his HR department and received our cards in the mail. It turns out a third party company needed documents verifying that we are actually married and live together, and in the midst of a move my husband somehow missed the letters. My insurance was cancelled and we’re in the midst of an appeal. \n\nAnyway...I decided to apply for a plan in the marketplace to cover my ass just in case we lose the appeal. The cheapest plan available to me (self employed full time student beginning in January) is $300 a month with an $8000 deductible. My husband doesn’t make a ton of money, either. With an $8,000 deductible and $300 a month I’m better off signing up for a local hospital’s plan for uninsured patients and waiting for my husband’s open enrollment period to roll around again.

Everyone pays a different price for the same service (depending on your insurance company).\n2. They cannot tell you what anything will cost prior to doing it (only business in the world that you have to do it first and then get billed whatever it will be later).\n3. No competition in my opinion results in being scammed to pay very high price for everything.\n4. The uninsured that go to the ER get subsidized by the people who have insurance (AKA the people with insurance end up getting charged more to compensate the loss the hospital incurs from them required to help people who walk in to the ER without insurance).\n5. Healthcare as a private industry and having to insure people with pre-existing conditions does not make sense. (Imagine you bought car insurance or home insurance after your car get in an accident or your home was destroyed by a tornado or hurricane). For a private industry it does not make sense. If we are going to insure people with pre existing conditions it would seem only logical to have a federal government run healthcare system and not private.\n\nI think the ACA could of been better.

Will the Court give a deadline for which Congress will decide something new or else the Marketplace goes away? "", 'Whelp, looks like it\'s time for me to get downvoted again.\n\nLook..I have a kid with a long, complicated medical history that includes a life-threatening illness. I\'m fortunate in that my wife and I have good jobs. Not only do I have good family coverage benefits, but we can afford an additional private policy for my daughter. \n\nI am somewhat terrified of what would happen if we let that policy lapse.  Without the pre-existing condition clause of the ACA she most likely wouldn\'t be able to get health care insurance.  We\'d have my family coverage, but only until she\'s 26... another clause of the ACA.\n\nBut ... honestly ... and I say this as a diehard limited government fiscal conservative... universal healthcare would be better than the absolute mess of the ACA.\n\nThe Obama administration thought the ACA would be a good compromise.  The people wanted the pre-existing conditions clause and jobless, aimless millenials needed their parents health coverage until they were almost 30.\n\nThis was going to force the industry to take a pretty sizable financial hit and, believe it or not, the government actually doesn\'t want to regulate the profitability of an industry if they don\'t have to. Capitalism...go figure. \n\nSee, if you drive the profitability out of any industry, investors take their money elsewhere.  Reduce the number of players in the market and you\'ll reduce competition. Reduce competition and guaran-fucking-teed prices will rise, along with inefficiency and terrible services. \n\nSo the government *usually* avoids regulating the profitability out of an industry because it works out badly. \n\nSo, then, the government and the industry reach a compromise. Reduce the financial burden and mitigate the risks by requiring *everybody* - even the healthy people - to carry insurance. Or pay a financial penalty if they don\'t carry insurance. Except for the really impoverished. We\'ll get back to them in a sec.\n\nThis almost kinda sorta works except insurance companies still base premiums on risks, so many of the plans that cover senior citizens and people with those pre-existing conditions are still pretty fucking expensive.  You can\'t force insurance companies to sell insurance at a loss (remember...drive out their profits = less competition = the whole thing goes to shit), so the government does what it always does when shitty ideas aren\'t working. Subsidies!\n\nAnd where does the money come from to pay for subsidies?  The same place all government revenues come from: taxes!  Well, and bonds, tariffs and repaid debts, but *mostly taxes!*\n\nNow, lots Libertarian and Republican types - myself included - are pretty skeptical when the government forces us to do pretty much anything, so *of course* the individual mandate was challenged and went to the Supreme Court.  But lots of us knew how this was gonna go down. \n\nIt was a tax. It was always a tax. The Court saw that. It wasn\'t called a tax for political reasons, but what else could it possibly be?  It\'s a fee the government was forcing citizens to pay.  *It is a friggin\' tax.*\n\nNow, I can like taxes or not like taxes, but the fact is that Congress can make new taxes, so that\'s that. Quit yer bitchin\', right-wingers and pay your taxes.\n\nFine.\n\nBut the whole set up just got us a terrible, compromised, half-ass attempt at universal healthcare.\n\nHere\'s the core of the problem with healthcare in the United States: the wealthy can afford insurance, no problem. A good chunk of the middle class has benefits through their jobs, so they are generally ok.  It\'s the lower-middle all the way to ""almost impoverished"" that are really getting fucked.  Along with uncovered people with pre-existing conditions, before the ACA.\n\nTo get Medicaid, you gotta be poor. Real fucking poor.  And the minute you have too much money in your name, you lose you benefits. Your kinda-well-off favorite aunt, Beatrice, left you $10,000 in her will? Aw, that\'s sweet. There go your benefits, ya rich piece of shit.\n\nSo that\'s what we\'re *actually* trying to solve, here. People can actually choose to be as poor as it takes to qualify for government benefits, but that life sucks. Would you choose poverty on purpose? What are you, a monk?  Nobody wants to live in poverty on purpose.  So we\'re trying to make healthcare affordable for a specific chunk of the population.\n\nThe ACA has all the hallmarks of what would be needed for universal healthcare, but it doesn\'t actually provide universal healthcare.\n\nIt covers people with pre-existing conditions. Check. It\'s funded by the people. Check.  The wealthy pay more, the less wealthy pay less. Check.\n\nSo why didn\'t it work? Because it was a public-private partnership where the government tinkered with the market with subsidies. I can\'t think of a single place where that has ever worked out in the long run.\n\nInsurance companies didn\'t make the money they wanted to and you can\'t force them to sell at a loss. They exited the markets, prices went up, choices decreased, subsidies had to increase and look...the whole thing is falling apart. Now the individual mandate is gone, and whether or not the whole thing is unconstitutional is kinda irrelevant. It\'s dying, regardless. \n\nSo where to from here?\n\nHonestly, I don\'t know. Personally and selfishly, I like that insurance companies have to offer insurance for my kid...but nobody can force that insurance to be *cheap*.  Any insurance company is likely to pay out *way* more for her care than I can possibly afford in premiums. \n\nDoctors, nurses, etc have a right to get paid whatever they can earn for what they do. People costs are not going down.\n\nRegulations have driven up the administrative costs in healthcare dramatically, but none of those regulations are getting removed - nor should they be - so those costs aren\'t coming down. \n\nFrankly, at this point I think I\'m okay just paying some more in taxes and expanding Medicaid eligibility. At least until someone comes up with a universal healthcare plan that doesn\'t look like it\'s going to bankrupt the nation. \n\n', 'I keep seeing personal anecdotes about why the PPACA is good or why it was bad on this thread.  I’d like to argue that it should never have been passed in the first place—not because I believe forcing people to buy health insurance ~~under penalty of law~~ “or face higher taxes” is, on its face, unconstitutional; and not for any argument against socialized medicine; but because the intended aim of reducing the cost of healthcare isn’t addressed by the PPACA.\n\nHealth insurance is, at its core, a payment plan.  You pay a little all the time, and any sudden spike in health care cost is blunted.  That doesn’t address the actual cost at all.  It *certainly* doesn’t address the cost of healthcare when you allow the health insurance company to set caps on what they’re willing to pay for certain procedures and expecting the patient to cover the rest, and it doesn’t help the cost of healthcare when you tell healthcare providers that they can’t haggle the price of medicines and supplies with the companies that provide them.  Add to that the fact that patients can’t really shop around on where they get their health care (either from the ambulance or by simply calling around to ask physicians/hospitals how much they charge for a procedure), and any argument a person can make for “free market correction” of the cost of healthcare goes out the window.\n\nWhat we need is government-funded healthcare.

Had a class with him freshman year and he rushed me for a few weeks, always got creepy vibes', 'According to the Prosecution, “Conflicting evidence and statements exist in this case making the original allegation difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.’’\n\nIf a Prosecutor thinks a case can\'t be won, they typically won\'t waste their limited time and taxpayer money taking it to trial for nothing. Hence they went with a plea deal, which the judge accepted. \n\nShe [stated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/us/baylor-rape-allegation-letter-from-prosecutor/index.html) that ""it\'s my opinion it would be worse to try Anderson and lose and have the entire matter wiped from his criminal history than to accept this plea offer."" She recently tried a case that was very similar to this one, but even stronger, and still lost it, letting the accused off with a clean record and no legal punishment. \n\nThe article also states that the lack of DNA proof and conclusive physical evidence likely came into play, when the Prosecution went with this plea deal. \n\nThe public backlash is by people that are ill informed and just assuming this case would be easy to win if tried, and wouldn\'t be unprovable and therefore a waste of taxpayer dollars. \n\n-----\n\nEdit:\n\nSpecifically, in regards to the plea deal, Prosecutor also wrote that:\n\n&gt;""Part of his probation will be getting sex offender treatment and alcohol treatment. Without these terms, and if he\'s just found not guilty, there will be no reason to think his conduct will be different the next time he\'s in a bar and finds a woman who can\'t defend herself.""\n\n&gt;""Given the similarities, I\'m surprised the defense attorneys on Anderson are willing to plea him to anything and I don\'t want to squander the opportunity for there to be some consequence for him that might alter his behavior in the future.""\n\n', 'What about the prosecution who offered?

Where\'s the mention of DNA matching his found on the victim? Where are the witnesses?! The victim\'s statement implied he forcibly ""took \\[her\\] virginity"". Then there must be *some* evidence of that from a medical examination.\n\nIt\'s difficult to get at the truth, because whoever wrote that train wreck of journalism decided to intersperse what they know about the case with opinions and hypotheticals from attorneys who practice law up to 1,500 miles from where this crime took place. They\'re also trying to play on the emotions of simple-minded readers by devoting paragraphs to drawing parallels to Brock Turdner, which is b.s. because there were *witnesses* who saw Turdner raping his victim, so the outrage against Turdner was wholly justified.\n\nWhenever there\'s these cases, redditors through gritted teeth always pretend to care about letting the justice system play out, but instances like this prove if they don\'t like the verdict--despite the assertion from the *prosecutor herself* that there are multiple contradictions in the evidence and statements--they\'ll whine about a corrupt justice system and demand mob action.\n\nRemember your reaction to these cases before you condemn the lynch mobs of 100 years ago, kids.

Ugh. \n\nBut now it sounds like they had conflicting stories involving the rape, the DNA and other physical evidence did not corroborate what had been said, and I\'m hearing nothing about this ""well a jury in Waco..."".

There, the publicly available evidence was sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim had in fact been raped. The Turner case is very different from this one where we have no idea what evidence the court was presented with. \n\nOur society has had a tendency of discounting sexual crimes in the past. We must be aware of this bias, but we cannot assume that every prosecutor who declines to prosecute or recommends a light penalty is acting on that bias.

"", 'I\'m going to give you the other side of this issue.  I\'m not trying to change your mind - just something to think about. Full disclosure - I used to do corporate law a long time ago.\n\nThese cases are a lot like the ""cell phones cause brain cancer"" from the 90s.  These were *huge* when I was in law school, and several profs used it as a teaching lesson (eg we played \'let\'s be the defense\').  The key element in cases like this is ""where are the victims?""  In the case of cell phones, as cell phones were becoming popular, we *should* have seen a corresponding uptick in brain cancer cases.  But we didn\'t - we saw nothing.  Despite the fact that by the late 90s, cell phones were very popular and growing exponentially in penetration annually, we weren\'t seeing a \'victim pool\'. \n\nI\'m not a medical expert at all, and its been a long time since I practiced, but the first question to ask is ""where is the victim pool?""  Talcum powder is *everywhere*, but mesothelioma is incredibly rare and declining (just 2,800 deaths per year).  Furthermore, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6608a3.htm) over 96% of deaths can be ascribed to stated occupation (from the report: ""Among the 96.3% of deaths in 23 states for which industry and occupation were known, shipbuilding and construction industries were major contributors to malignant mesothelioma mortality."")\n\nThis report that\'s linked to the article above would be a shitload more compelling if there was a huge population of mesothelioma cases where \'unknown\' was the exposure vector.  As stands, that \'victim pool\' does not appear to exist - that dramatically weakens this case, particularly given the fact that J&amp;J ships millions of tons of baby powder every year. \n\nSo to be clear, I\'m not trying to justify anything; what I\'m trying to do is look at this as analytically as possible and approach it like I was defending the case.  You better believe there will be a ton of research done about this, and these are the types of questions that will be asked.  \n\nEDIT: because its coming up, the 11,700 defendants in the lawsuit are part of the \'talcum powder causes ovarian cancer\' lawsuit.  This asbestos claim is (kinda) tangential, but not really related.  I commented on this elsewhere: \n\n[The talcum powder causes ovarian cancer case is] not going to get reduced, its going to be reversed outright.  First, the only report that showed a talc &amp; cancer link was paid for by the plaintiffs in that case.  \n\nSecondly: \n&gt;Two studies using a more rigorous design called prospective cohort studies, however, failed to show any association overall between talc use and increased risk of ovarian cancers.\n\nHere\'s a [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evidence-on-talc-cancer-risk-differs-for-jurors-researchers/) article on this.

[An environmental assessment had already been conducted under Obama.](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/keystone-xl-pipeline-environmental-impact-statement/789/) This judge has no reason to say that a new assessment has to be conducted. Their is no law/rule that says Trump had to do another assessment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Furthermore, pipelines are the best and safest way to transport oil.](https://www.strata.org/pdf/2017/pipelines.pdf)\n\n&gt;Transporting oil and gas by pipeline is generally cheaper than transporting it by rail or truck. **On average, it costs about $5 per barrel to transport oil and gas by pipeline compared to $10-$15 a barrel for rail and $20 a barrel by truck.11**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, when compared with both train and truck transportation, pipeline is actually the safest method of transporting oil and gas. **Oil and gas transportation by pipeline resulted in 1.7 fatalities to operators, personnel, and the general public per year in the United States. Rail transportation resulted in 2.4 fatalities and transportation by truck killed 10.2 people per year.** Kenneth Green, an expert on crude-oil transportation at the Fraser Institute observed, “on an apples-to-apples basis, pipelines have less accidents \\[...\\] and cause less harm to human health than do railcars moving comparable amounts of oil and gas.”17\n\nThey also cause some of the least amount of environmental damages from spills.\n\n&gt;In 2013, The United States Energy Information Administration reported that pipelines delivered over 7 million barrels of refinable product a day. **Pipelines spill an average of 269 barrels for every million tons moved per mile per year.22**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From 1975 to 2012 rail spilled a total of 800,000 barrels of oil. Since the use of rail for oil transportation increased in the mid-2000s, however, the amount of oil spilled by rail has skyrocketed. In 2013 alone, 1.5 million barrels of domestically produced oil were spilled.25 Despite this recent increase in the amount spilled, railroads spill fewer gallons than trucks or pipelines per million tons moved every mile. **Rail spills, on average, only 83 barrels per million tons moved per mile a year.26**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trucks spilled more oil and gas than both rail and pipeline, **averaging around 326 barrels per million tons moved every mile**.27 Road transportation is also closer to the general public. While pipelines and railways typically pass through rural areas with limited populations, oil trucks often pass through densely populated areas where spills and accidents have greater potential for human fatality and injury. **Although pipeline spills do occur, they are rare in relation to the massive quantity of product they move per year. When the amount transported is considered, transportation by pipeline is 4.5 times less likely to result in a spill than transport by rail.**28\n\nWhile yes, the more we invest into fossil fuels, the longer they will be around. But we cannot switch over immediately. We should all prefer that oil be moved the easiest and most efficient way. And no one should be ok with judges making decisions that they shouldn't make, in which they don't have the power or knowledge to make an actual decision."", ""I don't understand, regardless of there being a pipeline or not, oil is still gonna be processed and used.

We have an important duty, and an incredible opportunity, to focus as an organization on keeping children safe, supported and protected, and preparing youth for their futures through our nation’s foremost program of character development and values-based leadership training. \n\nTo do so in perpetuity, we are working with experts to explore all options available to ensure that the local and national programming of the Boy Scout of America continues uninterrupted. We have a social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, and we also have an obligation to carry out our mission to serve youth, families and local communities through our programs. \n\nWe care deeply about all victims of child sex abuse and we are steadfast in our belief that one incident of child abuse is one too many. We sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in our programs. As you all know, we have always taken care of victims – we believe them, we believe in fairly compensating them and we have paid for unlimited counseling, by a provider of their choice, regardless of the amount of time that has passed since an instance of abuse. Throughout our history we have taken proactive steps to help victims heal and prevent future abuse. I want to stress that at no time in our history have we knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we always seek to act swiftly when alerted to abuse allegations. \n\nPlease know that these matters continue to have the full attention of the highest levels of our organization, and we will communicate transparently as there are developments or updates to share. I wanted to update you today due to the news speculation, and I want to assure you that our daily mission will continue and that there are no imminent actions or immediate decisions expected. \n\nThank you for your continued support of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nMichael B.

I was extremely fortunate to grow up in the program myself and benefit from amazing examples of good men who never laid a finger on me and I'm so happy to pass along their gift of time and mentor-ship. \n\nBut the situation IS dangerous. You're talking about organizations that put kids in the middle of nowhere with adults. You HAVE to be extra cautious of who the leaders are and the best we can do is run background checks and set up rules like no leaders and kids sharing tents and requiring multiple leaders on any trips. \n\nBeyond that, be open to any concerns presented and be swift/immediate in action if any threat becomes known. If I was in the BSA leadership or the Catholic Church leadership for that matter I would basically set up a fund to specifically review these claims and do everything I could to harm and punish the offenders while protecting and restitution (as best as may be done) the victims. Responding with mere PR damage control isn't enough.
